As spoke, can't vote on Media Committee. Sanda responded that no one can predict the future. Eric Brooks: two things in response to Eric. Media committee has no been active of late and is assuming that once it becomes active some members will drop out due to missing meetings.

<p>(07) Discussion: Review of draft agenda for the Ventura GA (5min) *Sponsor*: Tarik Kanaana *Proposal*: Draft Agenda of the November 2017 General Assembly, Ventura, November 11-12, 2017 *Reference*: <a href="../../../node/1394.html">http://cagreens.org/ga/2017-11/draft-agenda</a> **NOTES** Tarik stated that the agenda was posted and was there. Changes from the last agenda were listed. June stated that there was an announcement on the agenda about the women's caucus. This item should be expanded to a lunch due to large interest.

Tarik said that a restaurant (pizza place) has been recommended by "Anthony". Time would be around 7:30 to 8. Email forthcoming. Tarik asked for a quick count of people who were planning to attend Ventura: Susan, Maxine, Sadie, Eric, Laura, maybe Ajay.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(08) Decision: Provide NationBuilder Access (10 minutes) *Sponsor*: Laura Wells *Background and Purpose*: The NationBuilder database has information on Greens around the state that can be useful particularly for volunteers in GROW/Grassroots Organizing Working Group and Clearinghouse Committee. Also needed are people who are tech-savvy and experienced in using NationBuilder and who can help others access NationBuilder. *Proposal*: That key volunteers are provided access to NationBuilder: Laura Wells (CC and GROW) to have full access including administrative capabilities; and Eric Luna (CC and NationBuilder knowledgeable volunteer), Nassim Nouri (Clearinghouse), and Michael Rubin (Clearinghouse) to have access to the data; and all CC/Coordinating Committee co-coordinators and alternate co-coordinators to have access if they require it and do not already have it, i.e. Bert Heuer, Mica Daniel, and Victoria Ashley. **NOTES** Laura made her argument that various people (as stated) need NationBuilder accounts. June affirmed. Motion passes by consensus.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(09) Decision: Extend Access to CaGreens.org (5 min) *Sponsor*: Sadie Fulton *Background and Purpose*: forthcoming *Proposal*: Proposal: That editing access be granted to Nassim Nouri, Victoria Ashley, and Brett Dixon. **NOTES** Bert afffirmed and suggested that more people not less is a good idea, Motion passes by consensus.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(10) Decision: Submission of SGA Item to Endorse Josh Jones for Governor (5 min) *Sponsor*: Sadie Fulton *Background and Purpose*: Background and Purpose: Josh Jones is a long-time social justice leader and activist, and a leader of Bernie Sanders' campaign who had previously supported Peter Camejo. He is running for Governor as a registered Green, and is seeking our endorsement in doing so. His candidacy offers us an enormous opportunity to bring more Bernie supporters and disillusioned left-wing Democrats into the Green Party. His election has the potential to be a landmark moment for the Green Party of California; regardless of how we feel about him, our membership deserves an opportunity to vote on whether to endorse him as our candidate for Governor. *Proposal*: To submit an SGA item on whether to endorse Josh Jones for Governor of California, on as short a time-frame as practicable given the holiday season *Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: **NOTES** Eric R: affirmation. He states their is another candidate who has filed. What happens when there are two Green candidates? Tarik: When is the filing deadline for declaring candidates. Sadie: responded that Chris Carlson could be added to this proposal as a friendly amendment. She stated that the filing deadline is January? Eric R: stated that he would prefer Josh. But he knows that some people in Sacramento would be put off if we did not add Chris Carpenter as a possible candidate. So he felt that GPCA-SGA should "endorse" both candidates. Does this mean we would have a GP primary. Ann: Because of top two, there would be two Green candidates on the ballot. She suggested that we needed to be united. Tarik: if one looks at the website under "Party", there is a link on GPCA endorsement procedures. And it says that the GA will not endorse candidates in contested primaries. If someone else has not declared, we won't know until the filing date has passed. He is just stating the rules - it has nothing to do with his position on Josh. June: the party has evolved in its thinking. Because of top two we have a changed endorement procedure - and we ARE allowed to endorse a candidate in a contested primary. Says the bylaws allow for an endorsement vote. Sadie: Josh is serious. He has financial planning. He has endorsements. Chris Carlson is running a non-serious campaign. June interprets Sadie's remarks as Laura: time check. She was concerned that we are running out of time. Can we move this item to Decmenber. Eric R: If we have the power to hold this online SGA vote, we should do it as soon as possible. He is arguing that Chris C should be added for fairness. Eric B: We should decide this right now. Friendly amendment to add Chris Carlson to the list of candidates submitted to the SGA. No concerns Passed by consensus</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(11) Decision: Endorse the People's Petition for Peace (5 min) *Sponsor*: Sadie Fulton *Background and Purpose*: The People's Petition for Peace was launched by a peace coalition after a delegation was sent to South Korea. The Green Party of Korea has been leading the charge in pushing for the abolition of THAAD, the "missile-defense system" pointed straight over Seoul, and that the anti-THAAD movement has managed to have one president successfully impeached. Now, there is a desperate need to block military escalations between the White House and North Korea, and the people of South Korea are looking to Greens in America for help. Jill Stein was a member of the South Korean delegation, and has done an excellent job taking a lead role on building the People's Petition for Peace as well as highlighting the Green Party's involvement, positioning us as a leader in the anti-war movement. These efforts should be supported, encouraged, and formally endorsed. *Proposal*: That the Green Party of California endorse the People's Petition for Peace, starting with a formal endorsement by the CC. *Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: **NOTES** Sadie stated that Jill Stein has been pushing a Petition for Peace and she feels that GPCA should support this. Pased by consensus.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(12) Decision: CC Action to Assist in Implementation of State Party Functions (10 min) *Sponsor*: Mica Daniel, Alameda County *Background and Purpose*: Throughout the calendar year, a variety of efforts have been pursued by the CC to implement the functioning of the State Party despite a centralized group of Green Party members refusing to cooperate in the implementation of State Party functions. Some of these Greens - whether members of the CC or not "” have effectively hamstrung the State Party in its efforts to continue to implement necessary Party functions, such as the administration of Standing General Assembly voting, financial management, welcoming new Greens, and other functions. The CC recently authorized the CC Co-Coordinators to pursue legal advice in anticipation of securing control of GPCA "assets." The CC also recently took action at its October 2017 meeting regarding: (1) the transfer of two PayPal accounts to the control of the elected Treasurer, (2) the transfer of GPCA funds currently in the One United GPCA bank accounts in Los Angeles to the Travis Credit Union account, and to close the One United accounts, (3) the appointment of Finance Committee Co-Coordinator Victoria Ashley as a person authorized to sign checks and/or authorize them via the GPCA bank account if/when the Treasurer is not available; and (4) the removal of all existing members who currently sign checks and/or authorize them via the GPCA bank account if/when the Treasurer is not available. In the meantime, the Co-Coordinators have sought and obtained legal advice to help in these efforts and, as a result of that advice, are making the following proposal: *Proposal*: That the Coordinating Committee affirm and reaffirm the following findings - 1. With respect to the State's funds that are kept in the One United Bank, (One United Bank Corporate Office: 3683 Crenshaw Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90016), it is the Coordinating Committee's intent that all funds be under the control of the State Party Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang and that the Treasurer be authorized to communicate with One United Bank as the Party's authorized financial representative; AND 2. With respect to any accounts opened in the Green Party of California's name with PayPal or other credit agencies or services, it is the Coordinating Committee's intent that any credit or charges to these accounts on behalf of the GPCA be under the control of the State Party Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang and that the Treasurer be authorized to communicate with such creditor(s) as the Party's authorized financial representative; AND 3. Also with respect to any accounts opened in the Green Party of California's name with PayPal or other credit agencies or services, it is the Coordinating Committee's intent that the State Party Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang be solely authorized to make charges or incur debts on behalf of the GPCA associated with such creditor(s); AND 4. With respect to other services for which the GPCA is charged recurring, intermittent or other charges or fees, such as NationBuilder, it is the Coordinating Committee's intent that the State Party Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang be solely authorized to communicate with such services regarding the authorization for any charges or invoicing for services on behalf of the GPCA; AND 5. It is the Coordinating Committee's intent that the GPCA Treasurer provide a financial update to the next General Assembly and include recommendations regarding budgetary and other financial matters. The report should also include an update on the status of the efforts to implement the foregoing items; AND 6. It is the Coordinating Committee's intent to continue to authorize the Co-Coordinators, Bert Heuer and Mica Daniel, and Alternate Co-Coordinator, Victoria Ashley, to communicate with legal advisor(s) regarding how best to ensure State Party assets are maintained appropriately and to report back to the Coordinating Committee periodically as these efforts proceed. *Implementation*: Treasurer, Finance Committee, Co-Coordinators, Alt. Co-Coordinator *Timeline*: Ongoing *Resources*: Time and effort on behalf of all of the above *References*: Fiscal Policy at <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/fiscal-policy">http://www.cagreens.org/fiscal-policy</a> October 2017 Draft Minutes of the GOCA CC Meeting at <a href="http://cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-10-02&quot;">http://cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-10-02"</a> **NOTES** Mica presented the item. There was no discussion. Passed by consensus.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(13) Decision: Request and fill in names of current recipients of GPCA emails and phone messages, and request that others be added where needed. Sponsor: Laura Wells (15 minutes) Background and Purpose: This item will be CC members providing names of all known recipients of GPCA cagreens.org email addresses and GPCA telephone messages.

Proposal: That, within 3 days of the November 6th CC call, the following people are provided access to incoming emails and phone calls. The reason for the first three (applications@, cc@, and gpca@) being available to all CC members is so that the entire CC knows: - what candidates are applying for the CC or the GP-US delegation as soon as they apply; - what SGA delegates are being appointed by the counties; and - who is applying for committee membership. <a href="mailto:applications@cagreens.org">applications@cagreens.org</a> - All CC members, direct forwarded emails or access to archives, per recipient's choice <a href="mailto:cc@cagreens.org">cc@cagreens.org</a> - All CC members, as above <a href="mailto:gpca@cagreens.org">gpca@cagreens.org</a> - All CC members, as above <a href="mailto:it-help@cagreens.org">it-help@cagreens.org</a> - Bert Heuer, Ajay Rai, Sadie Fulton <a href="mailto:liaison@cagreens.org">liaison@cagreens.org</a> - Jared Laiti <a href="mailto:lists@cagreens.org">lists@cagreens.org</a> - Laura Wells (GROW) <a href="mailto:treasurer@cagreens.org">treasurer@cagreens.org</a> - Ruscal Cuyangyang (Treasurer) and Victoria Ashley (Finance Committee) 916.448.3437 - Nassim Nouri (Clearinghouse Committee) for herself and those she designates See Appendix E: IT Roster in two formats: (I) Individual Capabilities, and (II) GPCA "Assets" **NOTES** Laura presented Laura asked whether Bert, Ajay, and Sadie can get access to these things. Eric B: Clarified that Ajay has given Bert access. Questions about inform list. Bert stated that he is not sure about NationBuilder and what access. Laura: answered Eric on the alternate inform list and that NationBuilder's inform list might be better. Bert tried to get Ajay to say that he would help with clarifications. Ajay seemed to be unwilling to help very much. Eric L said he has NationBuilder experience and could help. Eric B had suggestions for actions to take.. Passed by consensus</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(14) Discussion: Current Status of GPCA Bank Account Holders and Signers (5 minutes) *Sponsor*: Victoria Ashley *Background and Purpose*: Updates - Treasurer does not yet have control of existing OneUnited or Provident bank accounts - Treasurer does not yet have control of existing GPCA Paypal/Payflow accounts - GPCA Treasurer now has Statecraft software and data - Nine different fines with SoS now total $8,170 - FC Member Bob Marsh and Treasurer visited the SoS to review the fines: They were able to correct one error in a recent filing and prevent another fine from being incurred. Waivers from the fines were applied for in 2012 and 2013, but not again since then. More than half of the filings made were submitted late (GPCA has been paying approximately $40 for postage for each filing). The latest filing shows the Party has a negative balance, which suggests an error in the Statecraft data, that will have to be analyzed. - As of 11-4-17 the Travis CU account has $1027.69 *Proposal*: To review updates if time allows. **NOTES** Victoria gave a report. Provident bank account is now closed and money to be sent to Ruscal. United situation is unchanged. Statecraft (filing software) work appears to have been badly done by the prior Treasurer. SOS has been visited about the various fines incurred during Doug's term as Treasurer. These are being worked through. Trying to work with PayPal to get it redirected to our new credit union account.</p>

<p>Request for Re-appointment to Media Committee Name - Victoria Ashley County - Solano Current Committee term - 11/2015-11/2017 I have been an active Green in the Bay Area since before 2000 and have served on the GPCA Coordinating Committee since 2007, on the County Councils of the Alameda GP from 2004-2013 and the Solano GP since 2014. I have degrees in architecture and psychology. I have been a member of the Media Committee for 4 years and am an Admin on the GPCA Facebook Group. I look forward to our Media Committee becoming more active again as we head into the upcoming elections. The Party should be putting out regular press releases on vital issues of the state, such as Single Payer, Top Two, water resources, private prisons, etc. to educate the public on our views, at the least. ===================================================================== =========================</p>

<p>IT Committee Meeting Oct 16th, 2017 Attending: Brett Dixon Sadie Fulton Bert Heuer (CoCo, Liaison) Ajay Rai (CoCo) Absent: Sanda Everette Gerry Gras Tim Laidman Nicole Montoya Quorum not reached. This is the third consecutive missed meeting for both Gerry Gras and Sanda Everette. Even though we did not have quorum, Ajay announced he would be stepping down from IT (to allow him to concentrate on his new job). He said he would remain long enough to assure a smooth transition. Next meeting: Nov 20th, 2017<br /> </p>
