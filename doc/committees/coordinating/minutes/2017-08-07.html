------------------------------------------
(12) Decision: A Proposal for the CC to Renew its Request to the IT Committee for a Roster and Include a Deadline for a Response. 

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*: During its February 6, 2017 GPCA Coordinating Committee meeting, the CC called on "the IT Committee to provide a full roster of all persons who have any passwords or permissions to administer, moderate and/or monitor any GPCA web sites, email lists, social media, NationBuilder, other databases, web document archives, and any other electronic media not open to full public access (with the exception of simple email list membership - for example it is not necessary to provide in the roster SGA email list members, but we do need to account for all administrators and moderators of all email lists)."  (See "Attachment: Excerpt CC Minutes Feb. 6, 2017"). To date, this request has not been answered.
*Proposal*: The CC renews its request to the IT Committee for a full roster, as previously described and determined in the CC's Feb. 6, 2017 meeting.  However, the renewed request should include a deadline for a response because, 8 months later, the IT Committee has provided nothing.  A 14-day deadline from the August 7, 2017 CC meeting is proposed (i.e., August 28, 2017).
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Implementation by the IT Committee by no later than August 28, 2017.
*References*: Appendix G contains an excerpt of the minutes of the CC meeting Feb 6, 2017 in which the original request was made.

A discussion was had regarding the information requested and how much of that information the IT Committee does or does not have access to. 

Mimi agrees to revise her proposal to extend the time for an initial roster, based on the information IT has access to by the next CC Meeting. 

Outstanding concerns:
Mike Feinstein has a concern, for which he is willing to stand aside, that we don't give volunteers deadlines as if they are paid employees.

Approved by Consensus.

------------------------------------------
(13) Decision: Ratify placement of revised draft GPCA GA Minutes from March 2017 for a vote before the SGA during the next SGA Online Vote

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County, GPCA GA Notetaker, March 2017
*Background and Purpose*: Difficulties prevented the revised version of the draft GPCA General Assembly minutes from March 11-12, 2017 from being properly considered by the Standing General Assembly during its June 2017 Vote.  The draft minutes were revised during the May 8, 2017 to June 18, 2017 discussion period on Proposal number 132, prior to the June 19 to 25, 2017 voting period.  However, not all the revisions were reflected on the version of the minutes posted to the SGA voting platform during the vote and the SGA did not vote to approve the minutes.
*Proposal*: The Coordinating Committee is requested to ratify the submittal of the revised draft minutes from the March 2017 General Assembly to the GPCA Standing General Assembly during its next online vote.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: The SGA Vote Administrators are requested to post the revised draft minutes to the GPCA Standing General Assembly during its next online vote. [Please note that some of the text from the previous posting of the item to the SGA has been retained in the Attachment below to aid the Vote Administrators.]
*References*: http://cagreens.org/ga/2017-03/minutes.

Mike Feinstein has an outstanding concern, for which he is willing to stand aside, that the proposed Minutes were not added in keeping with our bylaws.

No other outstanding concerns.

Approved by Consensus. 

------------------------------------------
(14) Decision: Revised Bylaws Interpretation: Holding extra GPUS Alternate Delegation election

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*: The GPCA State Coordinating Committee approved a bylaws interpretation on July 10, 2017 that was put forward simultaneously with the special election for two Alternate GPUS Delegate seats that the interpretation authorized.  After the proposal was approved, a variety of factors caused the proposal not to be posted to the SGA Voting Platform within the time frames identified in the proposal.  Not the least of these reasons was that the proposed time periods for discussion and voting by the SGA did not conform to the GPCA Bylaws.
*Proposal*: That the CC adopt a revised Bylaws Interpretation (see Attachment: Revised Proposed Bylaws Interpretation) to be placed before the SGA for a vote during the next upcoming regular SGA Vote that allows for the appropriate discussion and voting periods and that such item be posted simultaneously with the special election for two Alternate GPUS Delegate seats that the previously proposed (and CC-approved) interpretation had authorized, (see Attachment: Special Election Item As Approved July 10, 2017).
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: At the next SGA Vote opportunity, the SGA Vote Administrators are requested to post this bylaws interpretation simultaneously with a special election for Alternate Delegate to the GPUS delegation as was previously approved by the CC on July 10, 2017 ("Attachment: Special Election Item As Approved July 10, 2017").
*References*: Revised Proposed Bylaws Interpretation [Please note that the proposal includes language to aid the Vote Administrators.]

Special Election Item As Approved July 10, 2017

GPCA Bylaw 7-6.3:

7-6.3 Discussion and Voting Period

7-6.3(c) Proposals may be amended at any time during the discussion period by the proposal's sponsor(s), except that the final amended version must be placed before the Standing Green Assembly no later than on a Monday at 12:01 am preceding the end of the discussion period.

7-6.3(d) The voting period for Proposals and Elections shall commence immediately at the close of the discussion period, and shall be for one week beginning on a Monday at 12:01 am and ending on a Sunday at 11:59pm.

Attachment: Revised Proposed Bylaws Interpretation

Bylaws Interpretation: Holding extra GPUS Alternate Delegation election

Floor Manager: [Name, Email address]
Discussion Dates:
Voting Dates:
Voting ends at Midnight Pacific Time

Background: The GPCA state Coordinating Committee approved the bylaws interpretation below on August 7, 2017.

GPCA Bylaws 13-3 governing bylaws interpretations state that such interpretations may be made by the Coordinating Committee, subject to confirmation by the Standing General Assembly (http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2013-06-23#Article_13-3_Bylaws_Interpre tation) . This interpretation is being put forward simultaneously with the election it authorized.

Proposal: That the Standing General Assembly approve the following bylaws interpretation:

-- WHEREAS an announcement was made setting a deadline for candidates to submit applications for GPUS Delegate and Alternate Delegate to the Green Party of the United States Delegation; and
-- WHEREAS the Green Party of California failed to update the deadline on its website to conform to the information on the announcement; and
-- WHEREAS at least two candidates for the GPUS Delegate election (Zee Zitola and Ahmed Eltouny) submitted their applications before the deadline on the website, but not before the deadline on the announcement; and
-- WHEREAS less applicants (nine) filed for election as candidates for GPUS Alternate Delegate than seats for these spots existed (twelve), leaving 3 Alternate Delegate seats unfilled; and
-- WHEREAS the Coordinating Committee approved a bylaws interpretation on July 10, 2017 to be presented simultaneously with a special election to to consider Zee Zitola's and Ahmed Eltouny's candidacies for GPUS Alternate Delegate, and that both items should be for one week of discussion and one week of voting, with the discussion beginning on Monday, July 17, 2017 and the voting on Monday, July 24, 2017; and
-- WHEREAS such elections should follow the GPCA Bylaw 7-6.3 with a six week discussion period followed by a one week voting period,
-- THEREFORE, the Coordinating Committee finds that a special election can be called to allow the SGA to consider Zee Zitola's and Ahmed Eltouny's candidacies for GPUS Alternate Delegate, and that it should be for six weeks of discussion and one week of voting, with the discussion beginning during the next scheduled SGA Vote.

According to the Delegate Apportionment Formula in Section 8-6 of GPUS Rules and Procedures Article VIII National Committee Size and Delegate Allocation, the Green Party of California (GPCA) is entitled to 25 delegates on the 150 member National Committee of the Green Party of the United States.

According to GPCA bylaws, the GPCA elects its GPUS delegates and alternates to staggered, two-year terms via the Standing General Assembly, during the same time period as elections to the GPCA Coordinating Committee.  The GPCA concluded its recent GPUS Delegation Delegate and Alternate Delegate elections on June 25, 2017.

On or about March 26, 2017, announcements were transmitted to various Greens throughout the State via Nationbuilder and other means announcing the GPUS Delegate and Alternate Delegate elections.  This announcement included an April 24, 2017 deadline to submit an application to become a candidate for these elections.  The announcement indicated there were 13 Delegate seats up for election and 12 Alternate Delegate seats.  While more than 13 candidates competed for the 13 Delegate seats, only 9 candidates competed for the 12 Alternate Delegate seats.

Despite the March announcement of the deadline for candidates to apply being stated as April 24, 2017, the GPCA website contained a May 1 deadline.  Due to the conflicting deadlines, at least one candidate for GPUS Delegate, Rich (Zee) Zitola, of Santa Cruz County, submitted an application after the April 24 deadline, but before the May 1 deadline. As a result, Zee was not included as a candidate in the election for GPUS Delegates that ended on June 25, 2017.

Proposal -

That the CC approve the following bylaws interpretation and authorize a special Standing General Assembly vote to simultaneously confirm this Bylaws interpretation and hold an election for Rich (Zee) Zitola as an Alternate Delegate to the GPUS.

-- WHEREAS an announcement was made setting a deadline for candidates to submit applications for GPUS Delegate and Alternate Delegate to the Green Party of the United States Delegation; and
-- WHEREAS the Green Party of California failed to update the deadline on its website to conform to the information on the announcement; and
-- WHEREAS at least one candidate for the GPUS Delegate election (Zee Zitola) submitted their application before the deadline on the website, but not before the deadline on the announcement; and
-- WHEREAS less applicants (nine) filed for election as candidates for GPUS Alternate Delegate than seats for these spots existed (twelve), leaving 3 Alternate Delegate seats unfilled,
THEREFORE, the Coordinating Committee finds that a special election can be called to allow the SGA to consider Zee Zitola's candidacy for GPUS Alternate Delegate, and that it should be for one week of discussion and one week of voting, with the discussion beginning on Monday, July 17, 2017 and the voting on Monday, July 24, 2017.  The Coordinating Committee also finds that, simultaneously, a separate special election shall be called in accordance with GPCA Bylaw 13-3 to allow the SGA to confirm this bylaws interpretation.

A discussion was had during which a number of CC Members expressed a desire to see the Alternate GPUS Delegate Election opened up to any candidates who wish to apply for the 3 vacant seats that were left open after the last GPUS Alternate Delegate Election.  Additionally, a question was raised about whether Ahmed Eltouny was registered as a Green in California. 

Mike Feinstein made a friendly amendment to open the election up to all candidates, which would change the time to allow for people to submit applications but suggests it be timed to coincide with the vote for CC vacancies.  He also expressed concern about who would run the election since the Vote Administrators had been censured.

Eric Brooks makes a friendly amendment to move forward with the proposal as framed, but only for Violet Zitola, then afterwards open up the other two seats to anyone who wished to apply.

Further discussion ensued.

June Brashares made a friendly amendment to open up all three vacancies but to follow the timeline set forth in the bylaws for CC vacancies in order to ensure people have enough time to apply and so that the timing is more consistent with one of our normal processes for timing.

There was further discussion.

Mimi agreed to June's friendly amendment. 

June Brashares clarifies that the proposal would have no effect on the current election for the CC vacancies.

Mimi clarifies that the intent of the amendment would be to open up the 3 vacancies to all applicants and to allow for a time frame for applications, discussion and voting consistent with the bylaws for CC vacancies to allow applicants time to submit applications.  

Eric Brooks has outstanding concerns but is willing to stand aside:  the censure of the SGA Vote Administrators does not take away their authority to run the upcoming votes; Violet has been waiting for months and the CC already voted to move forward with the special election; Eric believes that a great deal of disrespect has been shown to Violet for which he expresses outrage.  Ultimately, he prefers we go the way he had recommended and move forward with an SGA vote for Violet and hold the 2 other GPUS Alternate Delegate vacancy votes later.

Sanda Everette has an outstanding concern for which she is willing to stand aside.

There are no other outstanding concerns.

Approved by Consensus.  
------------------------------------------
Given the decision on Item 14, Mike Feinstein agrees to drop his proposed item (15):

(15) Decision: Bylaws Interpretation Regarding Election of GPUS Delegation Alternate seats (10 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mike Feinstein
*Background*:

GPCA Bylaws Section 13-3 Bylaws Interpretation states: "In cases of ambiguity or procedural disagreement, the General Assembly shall decide for itself the meaning of its governing documents, the appropriate procedure to be followed and what amendments are necessary to resolve any further ambiguity or disagreement. Between General Assembly meetings, the Coordinating Committee shall decide these questions. (http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/interpretations)

An issue arose this spring that created such an ambiguity regarding the application process for the GPCA's GPUS Delegation. Traditionally in past years, a running summary was kept on the GPUS Delegation email list and published on the SGA voting page, of who had applied for GPUS Delegate and GPUS Alternate.  Armed with such information, many potential applicants decided whether they would go for Delegate or Alternate - depending in part about how many others were running - or whether they would run at all.

This year in the Spring of 2017, the GPCA's email lists were down for several weeks during the application period.  As a result, interested GPCA members were not in possession of the same kind of basic information about who had already applied for Delegate and Alternate positions, that GPCA members in previous years had access to.

While one can not make an absolute casual connection between this lack of information and who applied for which seats, 22 candidates applied for 13 delegate seats, leaving nine candidates un-elected, while only nine candidates applied for 12 delegate seats, leaving three open seats that could have been filled if more candidates ran for alternate.  In past years, when armed with the information about who was running for which seats, applicants spread out over both the Delegate and Alternate seats to maximize the overall number of Greens elected to the Delegation.

Given that basic information was not available to potential applicants during the application period that had been in the past, the bylaws ambiguity comes up that the bylaws have not required such information to be available in the past, but they have been supported by such information being available - meaning that the

*Proposal*:

That the Coordinating Committee approve the following bylaws interpretation under the authority granted to it under GPCA Bylaws 13-3 and then submit it to the next Standing General Assembly for approval as provided by Bylaws 13-3.

Bylaws Interpretation: Special election to fill three Alternate positions on the GPUS Delegation

Whereas the GPCA's timeline for Standing General Assembly applications, discussion and voting is based upon the practice of predictable communications via the GPCA's email lists, web pages, voting pages and the GPCA Inform list; and

Whereas in April 2017, the GPCA's switch to Liquid Web hosting services destabilized the GPCA's email lists, meaning information normally sent to those lists did not get sent; and

Whereas traditional GPCA practice has been to disseminate during the application period, the SGA voting page links on which the CC and GPUS Delegation elections would be held, showing which candidates have applied up to that point, providing that information to potential applicants; and

Whereas during April 2017 because of the GPCA's email list problems, these links and this information was not able to be made widely available; and

Whereas in the past GPCA members used this information to decide whether to run for GPUS Delegate or Alternate; and

Whereas in April 2017 an unprecedented number of applications for were received for  GPUS Delegation (22 for 13 seats ), while fewer applications were received than seats for GPUS Delegation Alternate (nine for 12 seats); and

Whereas in past years, when armed with the information about who was running for which seats, applicants generally spread out over both the Delegate and Alternate seats to maximize the overall number of Greens elected to the Delegation, while in 2017 only 22 seats were filled when filing 25 seats was possible;

Therefore the GPCA shall hold a special election to fill the remaining three Alternate seats for the remainder of the July 2017 to July 2019 term, and that any GPCA member who correctly follows the application process may qualify for the ballot.

------------------------------------------
(16) Decision: Ratification and Timing of Items to be Posted to the SGA Voting Platform for an Online Vote (2 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*: A call for applicants to fill 2 Coordinating Committee vacancies was sent to state Greens via the Inform list and other methods on or about July 10, 2017.  The announcement (see "Attachment: July 10 call for Nominations") set an SGA Discussion/Voting period for the election to fill these vacancies as Aug. 14-Sept.24 (Discussion)/Sept. 25-Oct. 1, 2017 (Voting).  The Agenda for today's Aug. 7 CC Meeting includes additional items proposed to be voted on during an upcoming SGA online vote: the revised draft March 2017 GA Minutes, and the revised bylaws interpretation for the special Alternate GPUS Delegate Election.
*Proposal*: This agenda item requests that the CC ratify the following items to be posted for an online vote by the Standing General Assembly: Elections to fill one male and one female vacancy on the Coordinating Committee; Approval of revised draft minutes from the March 2017 General Assembly; and Simultaneous Approval of a Bylaws Interpretation and Special Election for GPUS Alternate Delegates.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: The SGA Vote Administrators are requested to post the above-referenced items in accordance with the CC's direction within the time frames spelled out in the July 10, 2017 call for applicants to fill two vacancies on the CC such that the discussion period is from Monday, August 14, 2017 through Sunday, September 24, 2017 and the voting period is from Monday, September 25 through Sunday, Oct 1, 2017.

Eric Rydberg rejoined the call at 9:16.
*** *** ****

Given the decision on Item 14, Mimi is modifying her proposed item (16) to remove the reference to the GPUS Alternate Delegate Election, which will proceed on the timeframe reflected in that item.  All other aspects of the proposal would remain.

A discussion was had about how this election might proceed since Mike Feinstein indicates that the current SGA Vote Administrators are unwilling to post it.

Mike Feinstein has an outstanding concern for which he is unwilling to stand aside.

Sanda Everette has an outstanding concern for which she is willing to stand aside.  She would like to send it in for the record and June indicates that, if she does so, it will be included in the minutes even though Mike Feinstein had expressed a concern for setting a precedent of including such notations in the minutes.

*** *** ****

Mike Murphy dropped off call and returned (~9:20) but has missed some of the discussion and will be abstaining from the Vote for that reason.

10 Yes Votes: Victoria Ashley, June Brashares, Eric Brooks, Susan Chunco, Maxine Daniel, Mike Goldbeck, Eric Luna, Ann Menasche, Mimi Newton, Laura Wells

7 No Votes:  Doug Barnett, Marla Bernstein, Sanda Everette, Michael Feinstein, Bert Heuer, Tarik Kanaana, Ajay Rai.

2 Abstentions: Eric Luna, Mike Murphy.

Needs 3/5ths of yes and no votes cast (11) to pass.  With only 10 votes, the proposal fails.

Tim Laidman joins the call at 9:24 pm.
Mike Murphy leaves the call at 9:26 pm.

Mike Feinstein wants to postpone Item (17) until the next CC Meeting:

(17) Decision: Appointment of two members to Campaign Fund Support Committee (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mike Feinstein
*Background*:  Under GPCA Bylaws 9-7.2, the Coordinating Committee was supposed to have appointed two members to the Campaign Fund Support Committee (CFSC) by the end of the June 2017 General Assembly in Sacramento. Unless something occurred toward that end that was not posted on the CFSC home page http://www.cagreens.org/committees/campaign-support, these appointments have not happened by the Coordinating Committee - nor by the Finance Committee nor the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group.
*Proposal*:  That the Coordinating Committee make its appointments as required under GPCA Bylaws 9-7.2
*Reference*: http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_9-7_Campaign_Fund_Support_Committee


------------------------------------------

(18) Decision: Establish a Coordinating Committee sub-committee to investigate Kern County General Assembly Finances (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mike Feinstein
*Background*: Over $5,000 was taken in at the Kern County General Assembly, but only a few hundred dollars were handed in to the GPCA for deposit into the GPCA bank account.
*Proposal*: That the Coordinating Committee establish a sub-committee to investigate and report back by the Coordinating Committee's September meeting including about how much money was taken in, where it was deposited, who authorized the money trail and other Greens, what are the potential legal liabilities and penalties to the GPCA, how can damage to the GPCA be minimized, how can the GPCA be made whole, and any related reporting and financial issues that arise and that the committee consist of Ruscal Cayangyang Doug Barnett Tim Laidman and two more members from the Coordinating Committee and two from the Finance Committee.

Mike Feinstein wants to give Tim Laidman some time to discuss this item.

Tim discusses his concerns about accounting for the state meeting in Kern County and how the county cannot be accepting the money for a state meeting and expresses concerns about filing forms with the State that reflect what monies came in for the meeting.  He does not want the County to be fined by the State for not filing the proper forms.   

The meeting was adjourned at 9:30 pm.

(19) Adjourn

Next meeting: September 11th, 2017 (The first Monday - September 4th - is Labor Day.)

Some people remained on the call to discuss financial issues but no decisions were made or notes taken after the 9:30 pm adjournment.

Application of Brett Anthony Dixon (for Clearinghouse Committee):


I would like to apply to be on the Clearinghouse Committee for the CA Green Party. I am currently serving as the media coordinator for the Oakland and Alameda county Greens and would like to also contribute at the state level. I believe I could represent the concerns of my city and county and could help improve coordination of our activities with the state.

I am a freelance web designer/developer and graphic designer and am very active on social media. I have recently redesigned the Oakland Greens website and have developed logos and flyers for the Oakland and Alameda County chapters. In college, I lived in several cooperatives that made decisions using the consensus process. I believe very strongly in the values of the Green Party and would like to contribute to improving and coordinating communications for the state party.

Application of Micheal Rubin (for Clearinghouse Committee)

I am writing to you to request your approval to be appointed to the Clearing House Committee.  My qualifications are a decade plus of continuous involvement in our Party. Currently, I am an elected county councilor in Alameda County, a regular delegate from my county to our state meetings and an SGA delegate.  I am also active in our Oakland G.P. group where I am on the Steering Committee.

My interest in this committee is fueled by the responsibility of Clearing House to respond to inquiries about our Party and how to get involved.  It is my understanding that our responses to such inquiries have been spotty at best.  I find this reality to be deplorable, especially now since interest in our Party is at the highest level it has been in years.  I offer myself to fill this gap, at least for Alameda County and possibly more when I see how much work is involved. I am retired and do have time to take this on.  It is my understanding that inquiries come to a central location and then are supposed to be passed out to county contacts.  However I also have heard that this system is not working well due to the lack of cooperation of some people.  I do not know if this problem has been fixed, but if not, I will try to help fix it.

Meeting NOTES:

Call in number: 505-398-0507 (No PIN required)

Meeting notice with proposed agenda was sent out by CCWG Co-Coordinator David Cobb (David was unable to be on the call.)

In attendance: Richard Gomez, June Brashares, Sadie Fulton, Mike Feinstein

Agenda


1) Functionaries (facilitator/notetaker)

Note-taker: June
Facilitator: June temporarily (hoping other people will join the call who can take on this role.

Others present at start did not want to facilitate because Sadie &amp; Mike thought they might drop off the call, and Richard did not have agenda available in front of him so June agreed to be facilitator only while awaiting more people to join the call and then would prefer if another person would do this role.)


2) Agenda Review

Mike F requested item be added to the agenda regarding appointment of two CCWG appointments to the CFSC with that addition we had consensus on the agenda


3) The next national Coordinated Campaign Committee Training

Referred to info about it that was posted to the CCWG email list prior to the call.

CCC Training features GPCA rising star Kenneth Mejia to discuss FUNDRAISING on Tuesday, July 25 at 8 PM Pacific.
Additional details about the training webinar are at weblink http://www.gp.org/ccc_webinar_fundraising

Please fill out the form on this page and you will be notified of the Conference Call number: http://www.gp.org/ccc_webinar_fundraising


4) Discussion of how to use SB 562 (The Healthy California Act) to grow the Green Party

Discussion comments included:

Democrats playing politics with SB 562.  Rendon held it &amp; turned it into a two-year bill. Blamed that it wasn't funded.  Nurses union is backing the legislation.

Podcasts on Intercept debating about SB 562.  Robert Pollin did study on economics of it.

Sadie lived in UK for years so knows it can be done.

Importance of the National context of what is happening with the ACA. Jill came under attack for Trumps actions.  Make point of Republicans and Democrats lack of support for single payer health care.

For those who don't know, the GPCA first supported single payer in CA when it endorsed Prop 186 in the November 1994 elections.

We may have a candidate in Dist 40 (Rendon's district).

It would be good to have news coming out of the GPCA state meeting General Assembly (GA) in November about the GPCA's support of single payer.

Need to develop deeper messaging, on economics etc;

Tweets about the GP history of supporting single payer healthcare gets good response.



By consensus agreed on the following Action items:

-&gt; Spread message to public that GP supports single payer healthcare and is a long-time supporter of it.  - All
-&gt; Create graphic that could be a used for social media (banner for website, &amp; for use on facebook, etcâ‚¬Â¦)  - Sadie will make graphic

[size for graphic for GPCA website needs to be: 985 x 349, bottom 349 needs to have some empty area at bottom that will get cut off so leave 40-50 pixels at bottom empty]

-&gt;Put graphic on slider of GPCA webpage (after Sadie creates the graphic)  - Mike F will put it on website
-&gt; Work on developing deeper messaging. Share relevant info on CCWG email list &amp; GPCA forum. â‚¬â€œ All
-&gt; Ask GA agenda team for placeholder spot on the agenda (approved agenda needs to be sent out by beginning October) for the upcoming GA in Ventura in November for a possible resolution/action on single payer health care.  - June


5) CCWG Appointments to CFSC

CCWG is to make two appointments to the CFSC http://www.cagreens.org/committees/campaign-support


Discussion comments included:

Concern about lack of effectiveness of CFSC's small amount of funding for candidates and on-going discussion on past CCWG calls expressing interest in revamping how GPCA supports candidates.

Jose Lara will be up for re-election in November.  Jose Lara is elected as Vice President and Governing Board Member of El Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera (Los Angeles).   Jose Lara is often asked by Democrats to join their party.
Would be good for GPCA/CFSC to at least prioritize a few hundred dollars of funds for Jose Lara for his November election.

CFSC could prioritize limited funds for supporting most important candidates.

With just the 4 of us on the call today, we will not make a decision now about appointing anyone to CFSC.   It will be put on the Agenda for next month.


Action items:

-&gt; June will find out what amount of funding, if any, is in the current approved 2017-2018 budget for the CFSC's budget line.
-&gt; Richard will send out notice asking for people who are interested to volunteer to apply to be appointed to CFSC



[at 8:20pm Sadie needed to leave the call]


6.) Discussion of Election Calendar for 2017 &amp; 2018


Discussion comments included:

Jose Lara will run again in November and will likely be re-elected.  It would be good to have him speak at GA in Ventura either on agenda or at evening program.


Agreed on the following Action item:

-&gt; Ask GA agenda team for placeholder spot on the agenda for Jose Lara to speak at the GA in Ventura in November  - June


Other info about the Election Calendar that was submitted to CCWG list prior to the call:


The filing period is open for local municipal, school, college and special district elections this November.  Signature gathering has begun for most November 2017 races and ends in most cities on Friday, August 11, except where incumbents don't run for re-election, which then puts the date back until a few days later.

Please post if you are aware of any Greens running in your area.  Once they have qualified for the ballot, they will be posted on the cagreens.org/elections part of the GPCA website.  If your county party has endorsed them, please pass that information along as well, as it will be listed on the same page.



Mike F reported:
Previously I have posted a list of Green officeholders whose terms end this November.  However Mimi Newton of Marin said that in her county, some of those seats have been extended to end in 2018, as part of moving elections to even numbered years. I have not yet received from her which races that affects.

Below is the updated info known so far:


&gt; Incumbent election Greens whose terms end in 2017
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Below are 14 incumbent elected Greens we are aware of, whose terms end in November 2017.  We know one of them - Jose Lara in LA County - is running for re-election.  We don't know about any of the other 13 Green officeholders.  Greens who live in Humboldt, Marin, Mendocino and San Diego counties should contact these people directly and see what their plans are for November 2017 - whether they are going to run again or not.

Excerpt CC Minutes Feb. 6, 2017

A full set of the Coordinating Committee Minutes from Feb. 6, 2017 is available at: http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-02-06

*** *** ***

15) Decision: Accounting of All GPCA Electronic Access &amp; Administration Permissions

Proposal: The Coordinating Committee calls on the IT Committee to provide a full roster of all persons who have any passwords or permissions to administer, moderate and/or monitor any GPCA web sites, email lists, social media, NationBuilder, other databases, web document archives, and any other electronic media not open to full public access (with the exception of simple email list membership - for example it is not necessary to provide in the roster SGA email list members, but we do need to account for all administrators and moderators of all email lists). The IT Committee is to include in the roster, all permissions of all types granted to each person on the roster. It would be preferable to get the roster in a spreadsheet format.
Sponsor: Eric Brooks
Background and Purpose: The purpose for this action is to get a full accounting of all people with access permissions and passwords, identify any who should be removed from such access, identify roles for such access that are either not being fully filled (or alternatively are overfilled), and to better facilitate the Coordinating Committee granting orderly access permissions and passwords to Green Party officials and volunteers who need that access to fulfill their Party duties and functions.

A discussion was had regarding the basis for request in terms of what is and is not happening in a timely fashion and we need a full list get it in front of us and review it and it might help fill in gaps in terms of who is available to do things.  There are some old names on some of the lists of administrators that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t with the party anymore.  Some people are listed as administrators who have no access or permission to manage the pages for which they are listed.  There was a discussion regarding the need for a volunteer on the IT Committee to do the administration of content.  There was a discussion about whether the request for the list included a time limit and it was recommended that Bert and Ajai work behind the scenes and raise the issue at the IT meeting to develop (but not publish any sensitive information from) the requested list at the next monthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CC Meeting.

There are no outstanding questions or concerns.

Approved by consensus.

BRIEF SUMMARY NOTES:

Updates / Discussion:  FPPC report, GA Donations and Cash

Cash from the March and June GA and Clearing House (from January) was deposited into the Provident account by Tim before June 30

Checks from March and June GA registration and Clearing House were deposited into OneUnited. Some deposits went in after July 1 due to a technicality.

Follow-up on Naitonbuilder, Bank Accounts, PO Box, Statecraft

Tim, Ajay and Mike are reported to have been in discussions with NB

Doug just paid for May June and July, negotiated down, charged $400/mo for those 3 months, discounted to $384/mo. They're giving us a credit of $48 when we do the annual contract.  We need to switch to annual rather than monthly membership.

PO Box is now paid up until Dec 31st

Bob Marsh notes that Alameda County's Form 410 was rejected 3x - the State now claims that county organizations are actually statewide organizations because they are a branch of the state party.  Also, they insisted on original signatures from county councilors to put on the form.  GPCA will also need to get signatures from the CC.

Doug &amp; Tim: Our filing software is assigned to a laptop that Tim has, and one computer that Doug has.

Fundraising letter

Victoria and Frank will be editing the existing letter.

Bob: It is important to follow up the fundraising letters with phone calls
