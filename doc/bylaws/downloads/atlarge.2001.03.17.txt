The State Coordinating Committee shall be composed of up to twenty voting members including fourteen regional representatives and up to six at-large representatives. There are ten regions as determined by the General Assembly. Two regional representatives are allocated to each of the four regions with the largest number of registered green party voters, as determined from the most current California Report of Registration available on January 1st of each year. One regional representative is allocated to each of the remaining six regions. Diversity and gender balance are encouraged through the election of at-large representatives. CC representatives are not eligible for the positions of Treasurer and Liaison to the Secretary of State. 

7-1.1.1	CC Elections and Term of Office
At the first General Assembly meeting of each year, an election shall be conducted to appoint three at-large representatives and any regional representatives for regional seats whose terms are scheduled to expire within the calendar year unless an alternate regional process has been selected (see selection of regional members, paragraph 7-1.4). Regional representatives shall serve for a term of two years or until their successors are elected. At-large representatives shall serve for a term of two years unless their successors are elected before this time.

The CC shall forward, without prejudice, the applications to the active county organizations along with a full and detailed explanation of the voting procedure, including a description of the "No Other Candidate" (NOC) option and an encouragement to delegates to make their choices seriously and a reminder that delegates do not have to fill all seats unless they feel there are enough qualified candidates. The Coordinating Committee shall appoint three election officials and after the current and newly elected regional CC representatives have been announced and before the at-large CC representative election proceeds, the election officials shall present a full and detailed explanation of the voting procedure (as outlined above) to the General Assembly.
