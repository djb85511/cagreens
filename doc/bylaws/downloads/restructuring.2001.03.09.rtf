Establishing a new Standing Group or dissolving a current Standing Group requires an amendment to these bylaws (see Article 9).\par \par 6\_1.3\tab Formation of Special Groups\line Special Groups may be established by the General Assembly or another Group with a 2/3 vote. The statement of purpose or charge of the group must be stated at the time of formation. A Special Group may be dissolved with a 2/3 vote of the establishing body, but in any case, is automatically dissolved two years after its establishment or after completing its charge, whichever comes first. Expiring Special Groups may be reestablished at the discretion of the establishing body.\par \par 6\_1.4\tab Standing Committee Membership\line Coordinating Committee (CC) membership is defined in Section 7-1. Other Standing Committees shall be composed of no more than eight members not including ex-officio members (see ex-officio members, paragraph 6-1.7). At least once a year or whenever vacancies exist, the active counties, Group coordinators, and individual CC members shall be given the opportunity to submit nominations or recommendations to the Coordinating Committee for committee membership. Eligible candidates must have attended at least two prior State Plenaries within the previous 12 months and demonstrate a working knowledge of the State Party Bylaws and operating procedures. Standing Committee members shall be appointed by the Coordinating Committee and shall serve for two years or the remainder of the current term. Terms begin and end on the second plenary of each year and must be staggered whenever possible. Members appointed more than 12 months after the start of the current term shall serve for the remainder of the current term plus two more years. Any Standing Committee member can be recalled with an 2/3 vote of the CC.\par \par 6\_1.5\tab Special Committee Membership\line Special Committee members shall be elected by the body which established the committee. Committee members shall serve for two years or until the committee is dissolved, whichever comes first. Any committee member can be recalled with an 2/3 vote of the body which appointed or elected the member.\par \par 6\_1.6\tab Working Group Membership (Standing and Special)\line Working Group membership shall be open to any Green Party member willing to participate. Voting privileges are reserved for those members who have attended or participated in at least two Working Group meetings within the previous 12 months (except for the first two meetings of a newly formed Group).\line *** In original Restructuring proposal, this was "must have attended one previous Working Group session." Bylaws Committee recommends requiring attendance in least two WG meetings to make it easier for a WG meeting to satisfy a quorum. ***\par \par 6-1.7\tab Ex-Officio Members\line Ex-officio members are Group members by virtue of office as defined in these bylaws or in the Group's charge. Ex-officio members have all the privileges of other Group members, including the right to vote, but not the obligation to attend meetings regularly. Unless present, ex-officio members are not counted in determining a quorum.\par \par 6\_1.8\tab Standing Group Liaison to the Coordinating Committee\line Each Standing Group shall be assigned a Coordinating Committee (CC) member by the CC to serve as liaison to the CC, an ex-officio member of the Group. The liaison is charged with facilitating communications between the Group and the CC. Liaisons appointed to Standing Committees also serve as one of the committee coordinators (see group coordinators, paragraph 6-1.9).\par \par 6-1.9\tab Group Coordinators (Standing and Special)\line All Groups shall possess two coordinators (see coordinator duties, paragraph 6-2.6). Standing Committees shall elect one coordinator from among its membership in addition to the CC-appointed liaison-coordinator. All other Groups shall elect two coordinators from among its membership. Elected coordinators shall take office upon confirmation by the General Assembly and, while still eligible, shall serve for two years in staggered terms whenever possible or until a successor is elected and confirmed.\par }\pard\plain \s18\fi-720\li720\widctlpar\tx-720\tx720\adjustright \caps\f4\fs20\cgrid {\page Section 6-2.

The stated objectives must be congruent with the Group\rquote s Statement of Purpose and the Goals and Strategies of the GPCA.\par \par 6\_2.2\tab Group Meetings and Deliberations\line Each Group shall determine how many meetings are necessary to achieve the objectives outlined in its work plan. Each Group shall prepare and announce the proposed meeting agenda at least two weeks in advance of the meeting date. New agenda items announced after this date shall be for information only and not for action. All deliberative and decision-making meetings shall be open to all Green Party members unless closed by a 2/3 vote of the membership. However, Groups may be required by the General Assembly or the CC to produce detailed minutes of a closed meeting. \par \par 6\_2.3\tab Group Quorum\line A quorum is more than 1/2 of a Group's voting membership.
