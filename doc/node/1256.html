In its decision, the GA membership called upon the Coordinating Committee to enact SGA email list rules which would be patterned on draft GP-US list rules, which would establish a three member administration team for the email list, which would not permit SGA list administrators to unilaterally and/or preemptively block or moderate emails from email list members for being &lsquo;off topic&rsquo;, and which would instead only permit emails to be blocked or moderated after complaints are made by other list members and after a joint decision of the three member administration team. In its June 2016 meeting, the CC established a subcommittee to finalize language of a proposal that will fulfill the will of the GA.</p><p>Purpose: &nbsp;</p><p>To fulfill the will of the GA by establishing these new rules for the SGA email list.</p><p>Proposal:&nbsp;</p><p>That the CC establish a three member administration team for the SGA email list&nbsp;<a href="mailto:gpca-votes@cagreens.org">gpca-votes@cagreens.org</a>&nbsp;, which would not permit SGA list administrators to unilaterally and/or preemptively block or moderate emails from email list members for being &lsquo;off topic&rsquo;, and which would instead only permit member emails to be blocked or moderated after complaints are made by other list members and after a joint decision of the three member administration team. Specific details of the proposal will be presented by Mimi Newton if they are prepared in time for the August 8CC meeting.</p><p>Implementation/Timeline/Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately upon enactment by the CC, CC members will choose the three member administration team and work with the IT and any other committee deemed necessary to implement the proposal.</p><p>References: Provided on request &nbsp;if members have questions requiring them.</p><hr /><p><strong>Decision: Rotate SGA List Administrators &amp; Enact Guidelines For CC List Administration (Brooks) (15 min)</strong></p><p>Background:&nbsp;</p><p>In the past several months, emails were blocked as &lsquo;off topic&rsquo; to the SGA email list, in decisions to which the GA expressed its disagreement in a 39-1 vote asking that new list procedures be developed. Recently both a member of the CC, and a CC email list administrator, each stated that certain emails being posted by CC email list members were &lsquo;off topic&rsquo;. A majority of GA members have made clear that they do not support preemptive restriction of emails as &lsquo;off topic&rsquo; without a better complaint and decision making process being established. However, it will take some time to establish and implement these new procedures. Therefore it will help fulfill the will of the GA in a more timely fashion to immediately rotate the SGA list administrators, and to provide guidance to the CC email list administrators (the CC Co-Coordinators) so that new administrators and new guidance can bring a fresh perspective to SGA and CC list administration; administration which in turn will more closely follow the will of the GA.</p><p>Proposal:&nbsp;</p><p>That the administration of the&nbsp;<a href="mailto:gpca-votes@cagreens.org">gpca-votes@cagreens.org</a>&nbsp;email list shall be immediately rotated and that three new administrators shall be chosen to administrate the list via a vote or votes of the CC immediately following the approval of this item; and that the Co-Coordinators of the CC shall be directed to adopt email list administration practices which are consistent with the will of the GA membership on SGA list administration. (To facilitate timely implementation, administrators chosen may be, but are not required to be, CC members.)</p><p>Implementation/Timeline/Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Immediately upon enactment of this proposal by the CC, CC members will then choose the three member SGA email list administration team and work with the IT and any other committee deemed necessary to implement the proposal. Those chosen to the SGA administration team will have their roles finalized pending agreement by each person chosen to serve in their administrator role. If not all chosen agree to serve, applications for serving as SGA list administrators will be called for from Green Party members (to be submitted at least two weeks prior to the next regular CC meeting) to fill any remaining administrator seats, and then the CC will vote on those applicants at that next regular meeting.</p><p>References: Provided on request if members have questions requiring them.</p><hr /><p><strong>Decision:&nbsp;Monthly Rotation Of CC Agenda Drafter &amp; Facilitator (Brooks) (10 minutes)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Background: For quite some time, the Coordinating Committee Co-Coordinators (and very few others) have regularly taken on the responsibility of Agenda drafting and Facilitation for our monthly Coordinating Committee meetings. Consensus based groups which do not regularly rotate these meeting management responsibilities face the very likely danger of falling into ineffective decision making and internal conflict, and it is very important that these responsibilities be rotated for each meeting.</p><p>Proposal:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That the Coordinating Committee shall establish that each Coordinating Committee regular agenda shall have an automatically scheduled item for the setting of the Agenda drafter and Facilitator for the next regular meeting, that it shall be established that a CC member shall not serve as a Facilitator for more than 2 regular CC meetings in succession, that a CC member shall not serve as a Facilitator for more than 3 regular CC meetings in any given calendar year, that a CC member shall not serve as an Agenda drafter for more than two regular CC meetings in succession, and that a CC member shall not serve as both a Facilitator and Agenda drafter for the same meeting.</p><p>Implementation/Timeline/Resources:</p><p>Immediately upon enactment of this proposal by the CC. The current meeting Facilitator will call for volunteers to fill the roles of Facilitator and Agenda drafter for the next meeting and CC members will then choose from the volunteers by consensus (or by a fallback on a simple majority vote if consensus cannot be reached) who shall fill each role. (A person being chosen for the Facilitator role may not also be chosen to fill the Agenda drafter role and vice versa). Those chosen to fill the next month&rsquo;s Facilitator and Agenda drafter roles will then work with the CC Co-Coordinators to make sure that they understand and have the proper protocols, tools and logistic understandings needed to properly serve their roles in a timely and efficient manner. This Facilitator and Agenda drafter selection process, as described above, will be repeated at each regular meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>References: Provided on request if members have questions requiring them.</p><p>-------------<br />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Committee Appointment Requests&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>BYLAWS</strong></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>Victoria Ashley, Request for Appointment to Bylaws Committee</strong></p><p>date: Sat, Jul 23, 2016 at 7:00 PM</p><p>subject:Request for Appointment to Bylaws Committee</p><p>Name - Victoria Ashley</p><p>City - Vallejo</p><p>County - Solano</p><p>Contact -&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victronix01@gmail.com">victronix01@gmail.com</a></p><p>I have been an active Green in the Bay Area since before 2000 and have served on the GPCA Coordinating Committee since 2007, on the Alameda Green Party County Council from 2004-2013 and the Solano Green Party County Council since 2014.&nbsp; I have been a member of the GPCA Bylaws Committee for 5 years, from 2011 to 2016, when my term recently expired.&nbsp; Locally, I maintain the website for the Alameda Green Party County Council,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acgreens.org/">www.acgreens.org</a>&nbsp;and for the Solano Greens.</p><p>I have degrees in architecture and psychology and am a Psychology Technician at Veterans Affairs, where we test veterans with PTSD on tasks of cognitive functions.&nbsp; I am also a co-founder, along with my husband, of a solar start-up, Sun Synchrony (<a href="http://www.sunsynchrony.com/">www.sunsynchrony.com</a>), which is developing concentrating photovoltaic panels for the rooftop.&nbsp;</p><p>For most of the time I&#39;ve been on the bylaws committee I have simply supported the ongoing work of Mike Feinstein in creating, updating and maintaining the bylaws, without making separate proposals or attempting to challenge his work, as Jared Laiti did for some time, until Jared gave up, without support.&nbsp; I directly supported Mike as a member of the Bylaws Committee, in the creation of the SGA, in 2012.</p><p>Since then, things have changed. &nbsp;</p><p>A bit of history is that early on, years ago, we had dilemma in which a handful of people were in charge of most everything (GPCA website, committees, GA agendas, etc.), and they regularly used the bylaws to maintain their control of the State Partyby surprising committee members (members with whom they disagreed) with sudden removals due to excessive absences. An Orwellian level of careful attention was paidby this group to each missed phone call, or GA meeting, in order to have a ready and easy tool to remove members they saw as a threat, when the opportunity arose.&nbsp; When we lost our only CC representative for Monterey County this way, that was the last straw for me, and for others, and people began to take action to turn things around.</p><p>And together, we did. &nbsp;</p><p>Later, when that group was removed from their control over the website, the committees, the communications, etc., I joined the bylaws committee with the idea of reforming the system for members who fell out of compliance so that &nbsp;those at risk of violating rules would be given the benefit of the doubt rather than being suddenly kicked out -- they would be warned in advance, or with a first &quot;infraction&quot;, so that they could have some time to correct the situation and clarify whether they wished to remain on the committee.&nbsp; This has happened several times and because we made changes to how we used the rules, we&#39;ve kept members we might have lost if we&#39;d surprised and ejected them.</p><p>Giving warnings about attendance and checking in with committee members is a reasonable way to maintain a functional State Party, keep our elected delegates and committee members from feeling alienated (or infuriated, as was often the case with the &quot;gotcha!&quot; removals using bylaws) and broadly keep our committees filled out and not emptied out.&nbsp;</p><p>However, recently, and repeatedly, I&#39;ve noticed that we find ourselves saying: &quot;Well, this situation certainly feels wrong, seems out of keeping with Green values, and will probably even make us look bad, but rules are rules, and we just have to follow the rules.&quot;</p><p>Feeling badly after rules are enacted, particularly rules to exclude people, is a red flag that the rules may be in need of reform or the processes in which they are being used may be going against our values.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2016 election, we used our rules to exclude our only Green Party African American presidential candidate.&nbsp; It felt bad to most of us, but, well, rules are rules. &nbsp;</p><p>I argue that rather than simply shrugging and saying, &quot;well, those are the rules,&quot; we can see those feelings as a warning sign that we need to take action.&nbsp; Examining what rules, and methods of using the rules, lead to such situations, is the first step to finding concrete ways to align our rules with our values.</p><p>I believe we can have excellent bylaws that are not used to effectively punish and remove people, to surprise them, or for personal gain by those who know the rules in the most detail.&nbsp; Rather, our bylaws can be used to guide, inform and educate our members, while still keeping our party in compliance. &nbsp;</p><p>That will continue to be my goal on the committee, now, for the first time in a long time, with more than 1 other person on it. &nbsp;</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Victoria Ashley</p><p>Solano Greens</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>Michael Goldbeck - Application to Bylaws Committee</strong></p><p>date: Mon, Jul 25, 2016 at 9:51 PM</p><p>subject:Bylaws Committee Application</p><p>Dear Coordinating Committee Members:</p><p>In case I&#39;m not appointed to the Bylaws Committee by the voting that ended 7-24-16, I am re-applying for appointment to the GPCA Bylaws Committee.</p><p>Why I want to be appointed:</p><p>I am applying for appointment to the GPCA Bylaws Committee.</p><p>Why I want to be appointed:</p><p>I am applying for appointment in order to assist the Bylaws Committee in doing the following:</p><p>To help get the GPCA Bylaws so that they are easier to navigate, have more clarity, and are easier to understand for the general membership.</p><p>To help develop bylaws that are more in tune with policies of inclusiveness and democracy.</p><p>Background and Experience:</p><p>I have been actively involved with the Green Party of California since 2014.</p><p>I am familiar with and know my way around the GPCA bylaws.</p><p>I have a good mind for legal matters:</p><p>My sister, who has been a successful attorney for the last 40 years, often solicites my advice on cases she is working on.</p><p>I have good organizational skills</p><p>I am retired and have time to devote to the Bylaws Committee</p><p>Please vote for me to be appointed to the GPCA Bylaws Committee.

I was elected to the CC in April of 2016.&nbsp; Although I&#39;ve been active with the Marin County Greens since 2012, my role within the County organization changed in the fall of 2015, at which time I took over more of a lead role in the County Council when my Marin Greens co-Chair was elected to her local School Board and needed to become less involved with the Party.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous to that, one of the things holding me back from being more active at the State level within the Party was some of the encounters I had with efforts to amend or interpret the by-laws at General Assemblies I was able to attend and in connection with my role as an SGA Delegate.&nbsp; Procedural red-tape appeared to me to have bound the State Party up to a degree that rendered us nearly immobile - and continues to do so.</p><p>I&#39;ve been a lawyer for 27 years and a government lawyer, with the EPA, for 22 years.&nbsp; I understand that the Green Party of California&#39;s by-laws have evolved over time for a variety of perfectly reasonable reasons.&nbsp; But I would hope to bring a fresh perspective to how the State Party&#39;s by-laws might be viewed and, potentially, altered to help make the administrative burdens from compliance with these by-laws less onerous while ensuring that the Green Party of California maintains all legal requirements associated with its status as a legitimate political party in California. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mike Feinstein (the sole Committee member) and I met briefly with Laura Wells at the General Assembly in May, at which meeting Laura and I expressed our respective interest in this Committee.&nbsp; Since Mike is the only member now, it is completely unclear to me how I might further participate in the Committee without being appointed as a member. &nbsp;</p><p>I also strongly believe that a one-person committee for something as significant as our by-laws committee runs afoul of one of our ten key values: Decentralization.&nbsp; It also runs counter to one of our Four Pillars: &nbsp;Grassroots Democracy.&nbsp; We have 9 positions (including liaison to the CC) for this Standing Committee, which means there are 8 unfilled seats.&nbsp; We have 5 applicants for these 8 empty seats.&nbsp; I feel strongly that it is time to end Mike&#39;s unilateral control over the by-laws committee and elect all five applicants to this important Standing Committee to ensure that we at least give ourselves a chance to reflect a broader perspective on the machinations of the GPCA.</p><p>Mimi Newton</p><p>Marin Greens&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>Laura Wells - Application to be appointed to the Bylaws Committee</strong></p><p>date: Mon, Jul 25, 2016 at 1:09 PM</p><p>subject:Application to be appointed to the Bylaws Committee</p><p>My name is Laura Wells, and I am applying to be a member of the Bylaws Committee of the Green Party of California.&nbsp;</p><p>My biggest qualification for the Bylaws Committee is that I have a strong bias toward action, combined with a healthy respect for Bylaws when they are used well. I have seen good Bylaws save an organization from individuals who tried to take over and control the organization according to their own agendas. After they were stopped, the organization went back to what members of the decision-making body wanted to do: discuss and plan programs and projects, publications and events. The way bylaws are being used in the GPCA now is harming not saving the organization.</p><p>In the past four or five years in the Green Party of California, the focus on &ldquo;rules&rdquo; has been to &ldquo;rule people out&rdquo;, and to keep the decision-making in the hands of very few people, even when there are other people willing to volunteer and help do the work. Through both Bylaws and &ldquo;Internal Procedures&rdquo; of the various committees (many of which were written and approved by very few people in recent years), way too many people have been turned away as Coordinating Committee members, Standing General Assembly members, committee members, and even as candidates for public office.</p><p>Committee appointments are a current example of how restrictive Bylaws and Internal Procedures are hurting the Green Party of California. Many people volunteered for various committees at the May 14-15 General Assembly and are still not members of the committees or even added to the listserv more than two months later due to restrictive &ldquo;rules&quot;.&nbsp;</p><p>In June&rsquo;s CC meeting, the agenda was created with committee appointments placed at the end, and the meeting ended before they were addressed.</p><p>In July&rsquo;s CC meeting, the appointments were placed early, but stalled again when a single person had unspecified objections to unnamed committee volunteers on all three committees, and did not stand aside. Recent bylaw changes surprised most CC members by requiring on-line votes for everyone, and again not a single volunteer was appointed to committees. While the GPCA is being stalled, nationally people are flocking to the Greens to support the Jill Stein campaign. We need people to do the work, and get the committees meeting again.</p><p>Ironically, the Bylaws Committee for the past 6 months has had a single member (the same person who objected to all three committee appointments). The Media Committee has had a single spokesperson (same person) since 2013, in contrast to an average of three spokespeople since 1991.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether a single person is a capable individual or not, the GPCA is much better served if the responsibilities are shared. Now we&rsquo;ve had online votes, and it remains to be seen whether the entire time-consuming process has stalled once again. Unlike the recent CC election, where you could see who voted and who did not during the election, this time we haven&rsquo;t been allowed to see the list. It&rsquo;s possible that people boycotted the election and quorum was not achieved. That fear (I hope it&rsquo;s not true!) is why I am re-applying, so that my applications do not become null and void. I&rsquo;m like a lot of Greens &mdash; I want to help.&nbsp;</p><p>We can create a better balance between focusing on bylaws and procedures and focusing on actions we can take to build the Green Party. I am asking for your vote so that I can be a part of creating that balance.</p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION (from my application to the Coordinating Committee)</p><p>I have been a Green Party activist since 1992. I live in Oakland, and have a daughter Natalia who was 8 when I started with the Green Party, and who is now 32! During this time, I have been a member of the County Council of the Green Party of Alameda County for two separate terms. I was on the Coordinating Committee of the GPCA during the 2000s. I served in various Working Groups and committees, including serving on the Media Committee as a spokesperson for many years. I was co-editor of the local Green Consensus newspaper, and very happy to be one of the co-founders and editors of the statewide Green Focus newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, I ran for Governor of California, and for State Controller in 2002, 2006, and most recently in 2014. My platform has been to reform old Prop 13 to keep the good parts and fix the rotten parts that have hurt California since 1978; to tax the rich; and to implement a state bank and other public banks in the state.&nbsp;</p><p>My employment has been in financial systems, pension funds, Pesticide Action Network, Women&rsquo;s Economic Agenda Project, SEIU United Healthcare Workers staff, and in Alameda County healthcare departments. I am currently a blogger at&nbsp;<a href="http://laurawells.org/">laurawells.org</a>, and I am an organizer with the new No Corporate Money Campaign where candidates run with no corporate and developer money, and voters vote for those candidates.</p><p>MY VISION FOR THE GREEN PARTY OF CALIFORNIA (from my application to the Coordinating Committee)</p><p>My biggest wish this year is that the two-party system shakes up and begins to break up. The Green Party of the United States is an important factor, and an expansive Green Party of California is crucial.&nbsp; I know we can make the GPCA more capable and more inclusive in 2016. The Green Party is the strongest independent party with good California and American values that we have, and it can play a big role as the electoral arm of the social movements.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much to be done to expand the GPCA so that we encourage the input, ideas, and contributions of people. We need to allow it to expand and grow, in finances, news releases, publications, attendance, volunteers. My interests are primarily in outreach, media, dissemination of information about the Green Party, and voter registration. I want to be involved in efforts to welcome back those who have re-registered out of the party, this year and earlier, and to welcome brand new voters and registrants.&nbsp;</p><p>Laura Wells</p><p>Alameda County</p><p><a href="mailto:laurawells510@gmail.com">laurawells510@gmail.com</a><br />&nbsp;</p><p>LAURA WELLS</p><p><a href="http://www.laurawells.org/">www.LauraWells.org</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;- my blog, CA, USA, Latin America...</p><p><a href="http://www.nocorporatemoney.org/">www.NoCorporateMoney.org</a></p><p><a href="http://www.richmondprogressivealliance.net/">www.RichmondProgressiveAlliance.net</a></p><p>@LauraWellsCA</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MEDIA</strong></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eric Brooks: Bio for Application to Media Committee</strong></p><p>date: Mon, Jul 25, 2016 at 10:41 AM</p><p>subject: Media Committee Application</p><p>My first introduction to journalism was through two years of journalism training in high school, after which I served a short stint as a co-editor and writer for a small town newspaper in Rochester, Illinois, where I learned the key basics of professional news reporting. Since 1985, I have been a professional grassroots organizer for various organizations including; OSPIRG, CalPIRG, Sierra Club, Human Rights Campaign, Forests Forever, In Defense of Animals, Our City San Francisco, San Francisco Clean Energy Advocates, and Californians for Energy Choice. The central core of my training and work for all of those organizations has been in messaging and media. I have also been a spokesperson for the San Francisco Green Party on various policy issues. All aspects of my work have continuously required extensive messaging expertise. I have appeared on local and national television and radio broadcasts. I have prepared and sent innumerable media advisories and press releases, a majority of which have resulted in published/broadcast stories in mainstream and alternative media. I have organized, held, and spoken at, scores of rallies, protests, press conferences, and panel discussions. I have been interviewed and had my own remarks as an organizer published and broadcast on numerous occasions, at times in hundreds of local and national print and online news outlets. I have also extensively and successfully lobbied local, state and national level politicians (often with concurrent media work used to ensure the attention of, and results from, the decision makers). I have on hundreds of occasions spoken as an organizer in public comment, at scores of local, state and national governmental decision making bodies and agencies.</p><p>Recent examples of press releases I have written and distributed are at&nbsp;<a href="http://our-city.org/Press_Release_Community_Electricity_Wins_Big_vs_Monopoly_Utilities.pdf">http://our-city.org/Press_Release_Community_Electricity_Wins_Big_vs_Monopoly_Utilities.pdf</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://our-city.org/Press_Release-Groups_Cheer_Historic_CleanPowerSF_Launch.pdf">http://our-city.org/Press_Release-Groups_Cheer_Historic_CleanPowerSF_Launch.pdf</a></p><p>My most successful media hit as a Green Party organizer was achieved just last month in a Bloomberg article, in which I was quoted - with excellent sound bites, and which reached hundreds of newspapers and online publications nationwide in the weeks following its publication.

I would like to return to the GPCA Media Committee, and help make it again as vibrant a committee as it can be, producing more frequent and more effective news releases and social media, and more publications for use in voter registration and campaigns around the state.&nbsp;</p><p>BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION (from my application to the Coordinating Committee)</p><p>I have been a Green Party activist since 1992. I live in Oakland, and have a daughter Natalia who was 8 when I started with the Green Party, and who is now 32! During this time, I have been a member of the County Council of the Green Party of Alameda County for two separate terms. I was on the Coordinating Committee of the GPCA during the 2000s. I served in various Working Groups and committees, including serving on the Media Committee as a spokesperson for many years (from 2009 to 2013). I was co-editor of the local Green Consensus newspaper, and very happy to be one of the co-founders and editors of the statewide Green Focus newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, I ran for Governor of California, and for State Controller in 2002, 2006, and most recently in 2014. My platform has been to reform old Prop 13 to keep the good parts and fix the rotten parts that have hurt California since 1978; to tax the rich; and to implement a state bank and other public banks in the state.&nbsp;</p><p>My employment has been in financial systems, pension funds, Pesticide Action Network, Women&rsquo;s Economic Agenda Project, SEIU United Healthcare Workers staff, and in Alameda County healthcare departments. I am currently a blogger at&nbsp;<a href="http://laurawells.org/">laurawells.org</a>, and I am an organizer with the new No Corporate Money Campaign where candidates run with no corporate and developer money, and voters vote for those candidates.</p><p>MY VISION FOR THE GREEN PARTY OF CALIFORNIA (from my application to the Coordinating Committee)</p><p>My biggest wish this year is that the two-party system shakes up and begins to break up. The Green Party of the United States is an important factor, and an expansive Green Party of California is crucial.&nbsp; I know we can make the GPCA more capable and more inclusive in 2016. The Green Party is the strongest independent party with good California and American values that we have, and it can play a big role as the electoral arm of the social movements.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much to be done to expand the GPCA so that we encourage the input, ideas, and contributions of people. We need to allow it to expand and grow, in finances, news releases, publications, attendance, volunteers. My interests are primarily in outreach, media, dissemination of information about the Green Party, and voter registration. I want to be involved in efforts to welcome back those who have re-registered out of the party, this year and earlier, and to welcome brand new voters and registrants.&nbsp;</p><p>Laura Wells</p><p>Alameda County</p><p><a href="mailto:laurawells510@gmail.com">laurawells510@gmail.com</a><br />&nbsp;</p><p>LAURA WELLS</p><p><a href="http://www.laurawells.org/">www.LauraWells.org</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;- my blog, CA, USA, Latin America...</p><p><a href="http://www.nocorporatemoney.org/">www.NoCorporateMoney.org</a></p><p><a href="http://www.richmondprogressivealliance.net/">www.RichmondProgressiveAlliance.net</a></p><p>@LauraWellsCA</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>FINANCE</strong></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>Victoria Ashley, Request for Appointment to Finance Committee</strong></p><p>date: Sun, Jul 24, 2016 at 6:58 PM</p><p>subject: Request for Appointment to Finance Committee</p><p>Name - Victoria Ashley</p><p>City - Vallejo</p><p>County - Solano</p><p>Contact -&nbsp;<a href="mailto:victronix01@gmail.com">victronix01@gmail.com</a></p><p>I have been an active Green in the Bay Area since before 2000 and have served on the GPCA Coordinating Committee since 2007, on the Alameda Green Party County Council from 2004-2013 and the Solano Green Party County Council since 2014.&nbsp; I have been a member of the GPCA Bylaws Committee for 5 years, from 2011 to 2016, when my term recently expired.&nbsp; Locally, I maintain the website for the Alameda Green Party County Council,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acgreens.org/">www.acgreens.org</a>&nbsp;and for the Solano Greens.</p><p>I have degrees in architecture and psychology and am a Psychology Technician at Veterans Affairs, where we test veterans with PTSD on tasks of cognitive functions.&nbsp; I am also a co-founder, along with my husband, of a solar start-up, Sun Synchrony (<a href="http://www.sunsynchrony.com/">www.sunsynchrony.com</a>), which is developing concentrating photovoltaic panels for the rooftop.&nbsp;</p><p>I have served as Treasurer for the Green Party of Alameda County for several years and recently became concerned about the state of the finances for GPCA, when I found out that the Sec of State&#39;s office was asking us for over $7000 in unpaid fines when Jared Laiti posted the email to our CC list. &nbsp;</p><p>My understanding is that Tim Laidman would be working to remove those fines, however, as a CC member, I&#39;ve recently learned that the CC is not allowed to discuss information about other committees on our list, so I now am seeking to join the Finance Committee in order to find out what has happened with this situation, what the current status is, and the plan is moving forward.</p><p>It would be extremely disheartening to have the fines increasing over time, if they are not fully being dealt with, meaning we are merely treading water in terms of donations received if we are continuing to incur fines.</p><p>Additionally, I am interested in getting involved in our fundraising letters and fundraising efforts.&nbsp; Alameda County has had a lot of success fund raising with a voter guide, letters and a website donate button (which avoided using PayPal).</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p><p>Victoria Ashley</p><p>Solano Greens</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><strong>Michael Goldbeck - Application to Finance Committee</strong></p><p>date: Mon, Jul 25, 2016 at 10:25 PM</p><p>subject: Application to Finance Committee</p><p>Dear Coordinating Committee Members:</p><p>I am applying for appointment to the GPCA Finance Committee.</p><p>Why I want to be appointed:</p><p>I am applying for appointment in order to assist the Finance Committee in doing the following:</p><p>Tighten up the controls for accounts payable so we don&#39;t end up with anymore large fines from government agencies.</p><p>Help provide assistance for GPCA fundraising activities so we have sufficient operational funding.</p><p>Background and Experience:</p><p>I have been actively involved with the Green Party of California since 2014.</p><p>I have some accounting background.</p><p>I am a quick study and very good at problem analysis and generating ideas for solutions:</p><p>I have good organizational skills.</p><p>I am retired and have time to devote to the Finance Committee.</p><p>Please vote for me to be appointed to the GPCA Finance Committee.
