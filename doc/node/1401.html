Mike F. has a three* part proposal:
1.  Remove item 10 and replace it with item 14.

Part 2 of Mike F.'s proposal:
2.  We address the item relating to AB 469 with online Vote.

Approved by Consensus.

Eric Brooks - proposes to add his late Agenda Item which was sent today with the heading - "please read now amended." Two other new legislative threats are now on the table to attack Community Choice clean energy and renewables in general, so the item below has been amended to include AB 726, AB 813 and a proposed 'Freeze' on all new Community Choice programs. (See Appendix O, below.)

Eric B. is concerned about getting to this item and wants it earlier in the Agenda, after the consent calendar.

Bert insists that it go last.

Eric B. is willing to stand aside.

Approved by Consensus.

Mimi -- proposes to add a late item on behalf of the Bylaws Committee, after Eric's Agenda Item.  See Appendix P, below.

The election closed at midnight of the 23rd after a week of discussion and a week of balloting. The votes were collected by Jared Laiti and then sent to Gerry Gras for ranked-choice calculation per the methods on Jonathan Lundell's website (which, whether by machine or by hand, serves as the "reference" for all of our ranked choice balloting). The results are:

Admins: Victoria Ashley, Brian Good, Laura Wells

Consent Calendar Approved by Consensus 

------------------------------------------
(06) Decision: Appointment of 3 members to the Finance Committee (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mica Daniel
*Background and Purpose*: The Finance Committee gets 8 appointed members and now has 5, due to two seats expiring and one which is now vacant. Three people have applied to be on the Finance Committee: Frank Lambert, Gloria Bram and Quinton D. Crawford.

*Proposal*: That the Coordinating Committee do any or all of the following three items in reference to the Finance Committee roster:

Item 1: re-appoint Frank Lambert

Mica spoke out in support of Frank's application.

Approved by consensus.

Item 2: appoint Gloria Bram

A discussion ensued and a number of concerns were raised and discussed.

------------------------------------------
(07) Decision: Appointment of two members to Campaign Fund Support Committee (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mike Feinstein
*Background and Purpose*: Under GPCA Bylaws 9-7.2, the Coordinating Committee was supposed to have appointed two members to the Campaign Fund Support Committee (CFSC) by the end of the June 2017 General Assembly in Sacramento. Unless something occurred toward that end that was not posted on the CFSC home page http://www.cagreens.org/committees/campaign-support, these appointments have not happened by the Coordinating Committee - nor by the Finance Committee nor the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group.
*Proposal*: That the Coordinating Committee make its appointments as required under GPCA Bylaws 9-7.2
*References*:  http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_9-7_Campaign_Fund_Support_Committee.  Specifically section 9-7.2

Mica - makes a friendly amendment to bring this item back next month and see if the CFSC and CCWG committees want to appoint people in the meantime. 

Eric B. - Asks if we could also do a call for people to step up to these committees? He suggests a friendly amendment so that Bert could send Mike F's proposal, with appropriate edits to make it a call for volunteers, to the Forum.

Bert agrees to do that.

Mike agrees to friendly amendments. 

Approved by consensus.

------------------------------------------
(08) Decision: Liaison appointments to Committees (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Sanda Everette
*Background and Purpose*: Media needs a liaison.
*Proposal*: Appoint Sanda Everette as Media Committee liaison.

A discussion ensued and a number of concerns were raised and discussed.

Mimi Newton has outstanding concerns for which she is not willing to stand aside.

Sanda's appointment as Media Committee liaison to the CC will be put to an online vote by the CC.

------------------------------------------
(09) Decision: Appointment to IT Committee (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Victoria Ashley
*Background and Purpose*: There is an open seat on the IT Committee.  Brett has computer skills and would be a useful addition.
*Proposal*: Appoint Brett Dixon to the IT Committee.
*References*: See Appendix L

A discussion ensued and a number of concerns were raised and discussed.

Ajay Rai has outstanding concerns for which he is not willing to stand aside.

Brett's application will be put to an online vote by the CC.

------------------------------------------
(10) Decision: Endorsement of the Repeal Top Two initiative (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Ann Menarche
*Background and Purpose*: Details to follow
*Proposal*: The ERWG proposes that the GPCA endorse the Repeal Top Two initiative (www.stoptop2.com)

At the time of approval of the Agenda, we merged Item #14's proposed bylaws interpretation (as updated in Mike F's 9/11/17 message) with this item and took the bylaws interpretation piece up first - 

Decision:  Bylaws Interpretation Regarding Endorsement of Statewide Ballot Measure
Sponsors: Mike Feinstein, Marla Bernstein
Time Requested: 20 minutes

Background:  Under GPCA Bylaws, only the Standing General Assembly is authorized to take a position on a ballot-qualified statewide ballot measure. At the same time under GPCA Bylaws, proposals to take a position on a statewide ballot measure only can come from the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group, as that group is the only Working Group or Standing Committee containing such authorization in its Duties and Responsibilities, as specified in GPCA Bylaws.

http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_10-5_Campaigns_and_Candidates_Working_Group

10-5.1(b) Establish internal procedures for and coordinate a process of inviting, receiving and compiling analysis and recommendations from Greens and others on statewide ballot measures, perform an analysis of each ballot measure in relation to the GPCA Platform, resolutions and Ten Key Values, and make proposals to the General Assembly for GPCA positions;

Unfortunately despite a proposal submitted to the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group (CCWG) before its August 28 teleconference to take a position on a ballot measure that has not yet qualified for the ballot, that would overturn Top Two elections in California, the matter was not taken up by the CCWG on that teleconference.

In past years, it has been almost exclusively the policy of the GPCA to **only** take positions on ballot measures once they qualified for the ballot.  In 2008 that policy was quantified in the Appendix to the GPCA Bylaws, and in 2013 became part of the amended bylaws describing the Standing General Assembly - but not in the Bylaws themselves:

http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_7-6_Standing_General_Assembly
7-6.2 Decision Items (as last amended 7/3/2016 and 7/3/2016)

The following decision items shall automatically be placed before the Standing General Assembly. Other decision items may be submitted to the Standing General Assembly by Standing Committees, Working Groups and/or active County Organizations as provided for in 7-2.1.

7-6.2(a) Endorsement/opposition of qualified statewide ballot measures;

At the same time the bylaws are silent on the issue of taking a position on measure that have not yet qualified for the ballot, primarily because the GPCA has not seen it in its interest to conduct such a process with its limited resources, until its seen whether a measure actually makes it to the ballot, because the qualification process is so difficult.

However in October 2009 at the Cotati General Assembly, permission was sought to endorse a ballot measure before it qualified for the ballot - a measure about a potential Constitutional Convention to be held in the state, that would focus on electoral reform issues.  

http://www.cagreens.org/plenary/archives/agendas/0910proposals.pdf

The request for this permission showed that this would be an exception to given practice - and was approved. (The Constitutional Convention item never made it to the ballot after all). At the same time, if the GPCA takes positions on every measure that is submitted - or feels it has to - that may create unnecessary burdens upon the party.

All of the above said, a measure that would overturn Top Two elections in California has been submitted to the Attorney Generalâ€™s office and will be cleared for signature gathering within two months.

http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article168541712.html

It was already the GPCAâ€™s position in the June 2010 elections to oppose Proposition 14 - The Top Two ballot measure at that time.  

http://www.cagreens.org/elections/propositions/archive

and the party has continue to oppose Top Two since 

http://www.cagreens.org/action/stop-top-two

Proposal: That the Coordinating Committee approve the following bylaws interpretation - 

Whereas under GPCA Bylaws, only the Standing General Assembly is authorized to take a position on a ballot-qualified statewide ballot measure; and

Whereas under GPCA Bylaws, proposals to take a position on a statewide ballot measure only can come from the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group, as that group is the only Working Group or Standing Committee containing such authorization in its Duties and Responsibilities, as specified in GPCA Bylaws.

http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_10-5_Campaigns_and_Candidates_Working_Group

10-5.1(b) Establish internal procedures for and coordinate a process of inviting, receiving and compiling analysis and recommendations from Greens and others on statewide ballot measures, perform an analysis of each ballot measure in relation to the GPCA Platform, resolutions and Ten Key Values, and make proposals to the General Assembly for GPCA positions;   and

Whereas in past years, it has been almost exclusively the policy of the GPCA to **only** take positions on ballot measures once they qualified for the ballot, in 2008 that policy was quantified in the Appendix to the GPCA Bylaws, and in 2013 became part of the amended bylaws describing the Standing General Assembly -

http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_7-6_Standing_General_Assembly
7-6.2 Decision Items (as last amended 7/3/2016 and 7/3/2016)

The following decision items shall automatically be placed before the Standing General Assembly. Other decision items may be submitted to the Standing General Assembly by Standing Committees, Working Groups and/or active County Organizations as provided for in 7-2.1.

7-6.2(a) Endorsement/opposition of qualified statewide ballot measures;  and

Whereas at the same time the bylaws are silent on the issue of taking a position on measure that have not yet qualified for the ballot, primarily because the GPCA has not seen it in its interest to conduct such a process with its limited resources, until its seen whether a measure actually makes it to the ballot, because the qualification process is so difficult; and

Whereas itt was already the GPCAâ€™s position in the June 2010 elections to oppose Proposition 14 - The Top Two ballot measure at that time, and has remained the GPCAâ€™s position to overturn Top Two; and

Whereas a measure that would overturn Top Two elections in California has been submitted to the Attorney Generalâ€™s office and will be cleared for signature gathering within two months;

Therefore given the circumstances above, that one a one time basis the Coordinating Committee shall make an endorsement of the measure that would overturn Top Two elections in California, and will put this bylaws interpretation before the next Standing General Assembly for approval of the Coordinating Committeeâ€™s ability to do so.

Bylaws Interpretation - Approved by Consensus

Endorsement - 

Background: The repeal of the Top Two needs the full support of the Green Party.  The Initiative Measure to Repeal the Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act allows every Partyâ€™s top vote-getter to move on to the General election.  Under the present Top Two, ONLY the top two vote-getters move on to the General election.  This is not representative government.
 
The language of the Initiative Measure is that of Prop 14 â€“ the Top Two law.  This language would be removed from the Constitution which means that the law in effect prior to the Top Two would, once again, enable voters to cast their votes for the individual in their own Party who they prefer.
 
Visit the website:  www.stoptop2.com for further details.
 
Vic - has concerns and wants to get to the point where we don't have to do these one time Interpretations - but, she is willing to stand aside. 

Approved by Consensus 
------------------------------------------
(11) Decision: Endorsement of US House Bill 3057 (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Ann Menasche
*Background and Purpose*: Details to follow
*Proposal*: The ERWG proposes that the GPCA endorse House Bill 3057 that would institute ranked choice voting and proportional representation for election of congress (â€œFair Representation Actâ€  introduced by Don Beyer of Virginia, Ro Khanna, and Jamie Raskin)
*References*: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3057

Question - does this need the same bylaws interpretation as the previous item?

Mike F. - initiatives are a matter for GA and SGA discussion and the CC takes positions on bills.

Mike F. makes a friendly amendment that the endorsement be sent to the Forum with a link so that we can get the word out to our congressional candidates.  

Ann accepts Mike's friendly amendment. 

Approved by consensus.

Mike F will distribute the message about the endorsement to the Forum.

------------------------------------------
(12) Decision - Direct Former SGA Vote Administrators to cooperate with new SGA Vote Administrators in advance of upcoming SGA voting to enable timely roll out (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*: An announcement regarding the results of the Coordinating Committee's election of new SGA Vote Administrators was transmitted via email to the CC on September 2, 2017.  The newly elected SGA Vote Administrators are working to get access to the SGA Voting Platform in time to run an SGA Vote on: (1) candidates for two CC vacancies; (2) approval of March 2017 General Assembly Minutes; and (3) a special election (with accompanying bylaws interpretation) for three GPUS Alternate Delegate vacancies for terms ending June 30, 2017.  Newly elected SGA Vote Administrators want the 6 week discussion periods for these items to commence on October 2, 2017.  It is crucial that the former SGA Vote Administrators cooperate with and assist the newly elected SGA Vote Administrators to allow for this to happen to ensure the smooth running of critical party functions such as conducting SGA votes.  This should include, at a minimum, providing requested information and administrative access to the voting system.

*Proposal*: That the CC direct the former SGA Vote Administrators to cooperate in a timely manner with the new SGA Vote Administrators to assist in ensuring that the new SGA Vote Administrators have the tools and information necessary to conduct the next SGA online vote with discussion to begin on October 2, 2017.

Mike F - Has a concern. Not willing to stand aside. 

Mimi requests that the matter be put to a vote.

Yes - Angelica, Vic, Eric B., Susan, Mica, Sadie, Bert, Tarik, Eric L., Ann, Mike M., Mimi, Erik, and Laura.
No - Sanda, Mike F., and Ajay.

Item passes 14 yes, 3 no.

(13) Discussion:  Add missing information and correct errors in draft IT Roster (15 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Laura Wells
*Background and Purpose*:

This discussion will be CC members providing all the information they can to fill in and correct the draft IT Roster which will be submitted to the CC in advance of the meeting. (Input is also welcome via email in advance of the meeting.)

This agenda item follows up items from the February 6, 2017 and August 7, 2017 GPCA Coordinating Committee meetings. In those items, the CC called on "the IT Committee to provide a full roster of all persons who have any passwords or permissions to administer, moderate and/or monitor any GPCA web sites, email lists, social media, NationBuilder, other databases, web document archives, and any other electronic media not open to full public access (with the exception of simple email list membership - for example it is not necessary to provide in the roster SGA email list members, but we do need to account for all administrators and moderators of all email lists). Information has been submitted by Victoria Ashley, Ajay Rai and others and will be incorporated into the draft IT Roster.

*References*: Appendix K contains an excerpt of the minutes of the CC meeting Feb 6, 2017 in which the original request was made.  See also Appendix N (IT Roster Draft)

Laura - requests answers to the questions listed in Appendix N
A lively discussion ensued.
Marla joined the call at 8:42 pm.

Five additional minutes were added to this item and the discussion continued.  Ajay committed to update Mica's access to CC Co-co-appropriate systems.  A new voting platform may be in order for the SGA.

(14) Decision:  Bylaws Interpretation Regarding Endorsement of Statewide Ballot Measure (10 minutes) 

This item was merged with number 10, see above.

------------------------------------------
(15) Decision: GPCA position support on amended AB 469 (15 minutes)

*Sponsors*: Mike Feinstein, Marla Bernstein
*Background and Purpose*:

At the GPCA's June state meeting in Sacramento, the General Assembly took a position opposing AB 469, because it would have shortened the signature gathering period for state and federal office from 70 days to 40 days (42.8%), but left the existing signature threshold as is, making it substantially harder to get on the ballot.

In response to concerns about this from the Green Party and from the Peace and Freedom Party, the State Senate Elections Committee recommended that the signature gathering period be shortened only from 70 days to 55 days (21%), while reducing the number of signatures-in-lieu of paying a filing fee by 30% to 33%, depending upon the office. The amended bill is a major improvement, changing the bill from a bill making it harder for Greens (and other small party candidates) to get on the ballot, to a bill making it easier:

(1) For the office of California State Assembly, 1,000 signatures, lowered from 1,500 signatures (33%)
(2) For the office of California State Senate and the United States House of Representatives, 2,000 signatures, lowered from 3,000 signatures. (33%)
(3) For candidates running for statewide office, 7,000 signatures, lowered from 10,000 signatures. (30%).

At the same time that the signatures-in-lieu threshold is being reduced, now each signature-in-lieu gathered is worth more pro-rated money vs. the filing fee, because fewer signatures are equal to the filing fee. This is important  because most Green candidates don't have the campaign infrastructure to gain the large number of signatures required of Green candidates as a result of the passage of Proposition 14 Top Two in June 2010, combined with its accompanying implementing legislation AB 1413 in 2012

https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB1413.

Before Top Two and AB 1413, previously Greens and other smaller party candidates only needed 150 signatures of registered members of their own party for statewide office, 60 for Congress and State Senate and 40 for State Assembly. AB 1413 specifically set the signature threshold for candidates from the smaller ballot status parties (Green, Libertarian, Peace and Freedom, American Independent) to be the same as for candidates from the Democrats and Republicans, except that signatures-in-lieu could be gathered from any registered voter, rather than any fellow party member.  Because most Greens could not gain close to those number of signatures, they had to rely upon paying the filing fee, which many prospective candidates could not afford, and therefore did not qualify or run.

As documented in this Sacramento Bee opinion piece written by Mike Feinstein http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article81520547.html, between 1992 and 2010, the four legacy smaller ballot-status parties (Green, Libertarian, Peace and Freedom, American Independent) averaged 129 primary election candidates for state and federal office in each election cycle.  By 2016 - the third election cycle using Top Two - the total number of ballot qualified candidates between all four parties fell to only 13, and for the GPCA only two!

The passage of AB 469 would mean it would cost less for Greens to get on the ballot than if AB 469 doesn't pass, because the pro-rated filing fee will be lower than it would if the current law remains in effect .

This change came about based upon the leadership of State Senator Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) in the Senate Elections Committee who strongly advocated for this change during the July State Senate Elections Committee hearing on the bill, after the GPCA had taken its position. At that hearing, the sponsor agreed to discuss specific numbers to implement Allen's request. After the hearing, Allen directed his staff to work with the Green Party, the Peace and Freedom Party and the bill's sponsor (Cooper) in the Assembly to come up with specific numbers for the change. Feedback to Senator Allen's staff came from the three-party working group of Green Party, Peace and Freedom Party and Libertarian Party members established in 2013.  Representatives for the Peace and Freedom Party in this discussion included Dave Kadlecek and C.T. Weber and for the Libertarian Party, Richard Winger.

The State Senate approved AB 469 on Friday, September 1 https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB469. The bill now returns to the Assembly for its own vote; and if passed there, to the Governor's desk for his signature.

Since AB 469 is being amended in response to the concerns and issues raised in writing by the Green Party and the Peace and Freedom Party, official Green Party support of the bill is very important - both for its passage and for the GPCA's credibility in negotiating improvements to laws affecting it.  While it is clear the the GPCA still believes the signature-in-lieu threshold would be too high, the GPCA has been advised that there are voices in the State Legislature suggesting AB 469 just the opposite - that AB 469 is too generous to the smaller parties and that every candidate from every party should have to play by the same rules.  At this point, one could say its time for getting while the getting remains good. The GPCA can always continue to pursue further reductions in the future.

This is not the only time that the GPCA has supported a bill where it got something in the negotiations, even though the party did not support the entire product.  In 2012 the State Legislature passed SB 1272, which eliminated County Central Committee elections for political parties (what the GPCA calls County Councils) in gubernatorial years, so that County Council elections are held only once every four years, not every two.  In exchange for supporting an amended SB 1272 - which was going to pass anyway without Green amendments, the GPCA got a significant extension in the time period for Greens to gather their nomination signatures for County Council.

In this case AB 469 was going to pass without the Green amendments. The GPCA would be very fortunate in this case that it would have turned a bill that would have made things even harder to qualify for the ballot, to an amended bill that makes it easier.  GPCA support is also critical because in order to go into effect in time for the 2018 primary, the bill must be passed with an 'urgency clause', which requires a 2/3 vote of both houses of the legislature and the Governor's signature..

Note: this is the second time Allen has helped the Green Party. In 2013, Allen was the State Senator who was primarily responsible for the GPCA getting its own section of the State Elections Code passed by the state legislature, when at that time as Chair of the Senate Elections Committee, he identified a sponsor for the code as an addition to a bill on electoral reform that was already in the pipeline. There are other elected reforms the GPCA has advocated that Senator Allen has indicated an interest in considering, including ranked-choice voting for president and lowering the cost for a full candidate ballot statement in the on-line versions of the Official Voter Information Guides.  GPCA support for AB 469 - after the Senator devoted significant staff time to hear the concerns of the GPCA and the Peace and Freedom Party and push to amend the bill - would only strengthen his seeing the GPCA as a viable working partner in considering such reforms.

*Proposal*:

That the GPCA adopt a position of support of AB 469 as amended and send the following to the State Senate and State Assembly Elections Committees staffs, and the offices of State Senator Ben Allen and State Assembly member James Cooper:

To whom it may concern

The Green Party of California (GPCA) supports AB 469 as amended, because
it improves ballot access for the primary election ballot via the
signature-in-lieu route.

The GPCA has long maintained that both the signature-in-lieu threshold - and the ballot access fee for state and federal office - was too high, both individually and in tandem, and thus inappropriate barriers to ballot access. AB 469 would incrementally lower the signature-in-lieu threshold, improving access, and in the process make each signature-in-lieu worth more pro-rated versus the filing fee - also improving ballot access. This is why the GPCA supports AB 469, even though the GPCA still believes the lowered signature threshold in AB 469 and the existing filing fees still create inappropriate barriers to ballot access.

Therefore at the same time that the GPCA supports AB 469, the GPCA will continue to support additional reforms to make ballot access more fair and accessible.

For example, the GPCA also believes that the ballot access fee is too high for state and federal office, and should also be lowered in future legislation. Currently that fee for statewide office is over $3,000.

This high fee must also be considered in conjunction with the fee for a full candidate statement in the official Voter Information Guide.   A full candidate statement in the Voter Information Guide (the most cost-effective way to reach all voters) is more than double that, at $6,250. The GPCA also believes that fee should also be lowered in future legislation for the written version of the Voter Information Guide; while for the electronic version that appears on the Secretary of State's web site, the GPCA believes that a full 250 word candidate statement should be allowed for a low fee for any ballot qualified candidate for state or federal office.

But for now, the GPCA supports AB 469 as amended; we thank Senator Ben Allen for advocating for our concerns in the State Elections Committee, and we thank AB 469's author Assembly member James Cooper, for his openness to amend his bill in response to our concerns.

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: AB 469 will return to the Assembly Floor before the close of this current legislature session on September 15, and then forwarded to the Governor for his signing.

A discussion ensued.

Eric Brooks has a concern about needing more information about the current position of the Peace and Freedom Party regarding the proposed legislation, and is not willing to stand aside.

The item will be put to an online vote by the CC.

(16) Discussion: Report on Kern County General Assembly Finances (15 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Doug Barnett, Mike Feinstein
*Background and Purpose*: Over $5,000 was taken in at the Kern County General Assembly, but only a few hundred dollars were handed in to the GPCA for deposit into the GPCA bank account.  There has also been no legal filing to account for the funds.  The GPCA Finance Committee discussed this item on its August 24 call, but came to no final conclusions. This item is meant to give the Coordinating Committee the opportunity to discuss how to bring the situation into legal compliance.

As Doug was not present, members of the Finance Committee indicated that Finance needs to continue to meet and discuss this item.
A proposal was made by Bert to table the item to next month.
Laura - made a friendly amendment, rather than just roll the item over, how about having the item be resubmitted with an update next month.

Mike F. -- agrees to update and resubmit the item for next month's CC Meeting.

Approved by consensus.

(17) DECISION: GPCA Opposition of California Bills &amp; Amendments Attacking Clean Energy in California 

- AB 726 (Holden) a bill that would privatize and regionalize California's electricity grid and turn it over to the influence of the coal industry and the Trump administration.

-  AB 813 (Holden) a bill requiring California monopoly utilities (PG&amp;E, SCE, SDG&amp;E) to purchase long term renewable energy contracts; which will unnecessarily raise the cost of renewables, and result in damaging costs which will undermine Community Choice energy programs.

- Community Choice 'Freeze' - Rumors have arisen that a last minute amendment may be inserted in an energy bill to freeze all new creation of Community Choice clean energy programs, which would crush the local clean energy movement in California.

BACKGROUND: California Assemblymember Chris Holden (D - Pasadena) who has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the monopoly utility corporations and their ally electrical building trades, has just introduced both AB 726 and AB 813 as 'gut-and-amend' stealth attacks on renewable energy and Community Choice clean energy programs - in the last two weeks of the California legislative session.

(18)  Subject:  Decision Item: Addition to March 2017 Draft Minutes from General Assembly in Kern County

Sponsors:  Mimi Newton, Bylaws Co-Co and Liaison to Coordinating Committee, on behalf of the Bylaws Committee 

Background and Purpose:  The Kern County General Assembly took place on March 11 and 12, 2017.  A Bylaws Amendment was approved at the GA without being reviewed in advance by the Bylaws Committee.  As a result, the Bylaws Committee held a Special Meeting on September 9, 2017, during which the Committee resolved to make the following recommendation to the CC: (See Appendix P, below.)

Eric Brooks - has a concern but is willing to stand aside - the Bylaws Committee is there to review proposed bylaws amendments for form, and to make sure the proposed text meshes with the bylaws.  The Bylaws Committee  does not have the authority to overrule the GA's decision regarding a specific bylaw amendment.
Vic - offers a Friendly Amendment to add Eric's point that the Bylaws Committee cannot overrule a decision of the GA.
Mimi - not willing to accept an amendment because it was the Bylaws Committee, not her, that put this recommendation forward.

Approved by Consensus

Timekeeper - note that Marla was on the call for too short a time to be included as present.

Reapplication of Frank Lambert (for Finance Committee):

Frank Lambert (re-appointment)

Being on any committee nowadays is challenging but I feel honored to serve as a member on the State Finance Committee these past two years. We Greens have an organizational problem, and I've been doing my best in educating the public on what the Green Party stands for as opposed to the Republican/Democrat duopoly.

I helped construct the two fund-raising letters during my short tenure on the Finance Committee and have been thinking about different approaches to raising money, such as reaching out to wealthy philanthropists who share our interests and concerns. As of today, I'm still proposing the $.14 (fourteen cents) a day or $51.50 a year per California Green.

In 2015 I worked with the Coordinating Committee and Agenda Team to host a General Assembly in Monterey County (http://www.cagreens.org/ga/2015-01). Monterey County also holds an annual fundraiser in the form of an auction, which has worked out well for us. I have been a Green Party member since 2005.

Sincerely,
Frank Lambert
Council member, Green Party of Monterey County

Application of Gloria Bram (for Finance Committee)

I changed my voter preference from Democrat to Green Party on the second day of their 2016 convention. My son, who is also a Green Party member, applauded my decision and took me to the very next Green Party of Orange County Meeting. 

At that meeting I was asked if I wanted to join their council, I did and I was. Now I am being appointed to the Standing General Assembly for Orange County.

I am a retired accountant (for 43 years, 10 with my own business) and was treasurer of an influential county democratic party in Washington state for more than 15 years.  
Now I would like to use my knowledge &amp; skills to help grow the Green Party where I can. 

I have been asked by a few State members to consider becoming state party treasurer and would like to explore what would be involved with that. To that end, I would appreciate being appointed to the Finance Committee.

I can be reached at my greengloryb@gmail account or by phone (Cell; 714-785-1686 or Home; 714-530-3398) 

Thank you for your consideration,

Application of Quinton Douglas Crawford (for Finance Committee)


Quinton Douglas Crawford

I am applying to become a member of the Finance Committee of the Green Party of California. 

My experience, from the 1990â€™s thru 2015, in organizations at the leadership level include: youth program logistics chair, student leader of the African Student Association &amp; Student Government Committee, Northern California Regional Officer for the African/Black Statewide Student Alliance, Solano County Facilitator of the Earth Charter.

I have been a member of the All-African Peoples Revolutionary Party, met Kwame Ture (formerly Stokely Carmicheal) many times, and now have a major part in â€˜Advancing The Research - Save Nubia Projectâ€™. 

My experiences as a fundraising chair in other organizations have resulted in several thousand dollars being raised.  In 2016 I was also a local election campaign coordinator of Bernie Sanders campaign.

I joined the Green Party in 2016, minutes after the illegal actions of the DNC were exposed by the endorsement of Killary Clinton. I later helped pay for mass social media exposure of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka presentations on CNN, CSPAN, etc reaching over 16,000 local people in the Solano County area. In 2017 I attended my first General Assembly, where I presented several ideas Iâ€™ve had for fundraising.

I am an educator and am currently serving as Secretary for the Solano Group of the Sierra Club. I am also working to occasionally motivate other Green Party members on social media, to stay on track and keep spreading awareness of the Green Party. I am engaged in monthly donations to the National Green Party and Brand New Congress (specifically to help Green Party people win congressional seats).

I hope to be able to engage more responsibility in the growth and organization of the Green Party of California.

From: Yolo County Green Party <yolocogp>
Date: Sun, Jul 23, 2017 at 1:13 PM
Subject: SAVE THE DATE: SEPTEMBER 23, 2017 IN DAVIS - CENTRAL REGION GREEN GATHERING

Hello Central Region Greens (and other interested CA Greens!),

The Yolo County Green Party would like to invite you to attend a regional gathering in Davis, CA on Saturday, September 23, 2017. At this informal gathering, we hope all Central Region Greens and other interested CA Greens can come together to meet, share ideas, and work toward rebuilding the Green Party in the Central Region and beyond. 

There will be speakers on getting "stuff" done and growing the Green Party. There will also be candidate panels, and workshops devoted to building the Green Party as a force for social and political change. Weâ€™re hoping this gathering will facilitate a serious discussion about how to circumvent and break through the many obstacles the current GPCA party structure places in front of real grassroots party-building and organizing. We would like to review some alternative party structures that might allow the GPCA to be the political force it has the potential to be. These are radical, grassroots, small-d democratic alternatives to entrenched power structures that stifle the party rather than grow it.

This is an informal gathering; there are no delegates or registration fees. All CA Greens are welcome. However, if you do plan to attend, please RSVP so we can coordinate seating, food, accommodation recommendations, etc.  A draft agenda will be forthcoming.

So save the date: Saturday, September 23, 2017.  IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND, PLEASE RSVP TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS: yolocogp@gmail.com.

We hope to see as many of you as possible!

The GPYC County Council,

Adam Siegel

2. Updates / Discussion:  Kern GA Money

Victoria Ashley presented her communications and understanding of the position of Kern County with regards to the finances around the March General Assembly. Mike Feinstein &amp; Tim Laidman presented their understandings and concerns about the finances also. 

Kern has stated that they were told by then-Treasurer Doug Barnett that GPCA did not have any money to provide in advance of the event except for $300 to secure the venue. Barnett was not in attendance on the call.  The lack of any advance funding led to Kern establishing an Eventbrite page to accept registrations.  Kern maintains that they were not engaged in any political activity but rather served to provide everything necessary for party members to meet and communicate.

Kern County GA Registration net amount (after processing fees): $4475.46
Expenditures included: food service (organic, vegan and gluten-free options) for breakfast, breaks and lunch for approximately 100 people for 2 days, venue security costs, band stipend and other costs for the Saturday evening event with GP presidential candidate Jill Stein, and payment of all incidental costs necessary for the event set-up and clean-up at the hall.
 
Balance with Kern County after all direct and other costs paid: $1543.73

GPCA payment for venue: $300.00

No decision could be agreed upon for the item:

    - Feinstein and Laidman want to investigate and want Doug Barnett to speak to the FC 
    - Other FC members do not support the need for further investigation, do not see the benefit of a he-said / she-said debate, and stress the need to focus on the still-incomplete fundraising letter

Excerpt CC Minutes Feb. 6, 2017

A full set of the Coordinating Committee Minutes from Feb. 6, 2017 is available at: http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-02-06

*** *** ***

15) Decision: Accounting of All GPCA Electronic Access &amp; Administration Permissions

Proposal: The Coordinating Committee calls on the IT Committee to provide a full roster of all persons who have any passwords or permissions to administer, moderate and/or monitor any GPCA web sites, email lists, social media, NationBuilder, other databases, web document archives, and any other electronic media not open to full public access (with the exception of simple email list membership - for example it is not necessary to provide in the roster SGA email list members, but we do need to account for all administrators and moderators of all email lists). The IT Committee is to include in the roster, all permissions of all types granted to each person on the roster. It would be preferable to get the roster in a spreadsheet format.
Sponsor: Eric Brooks
Background and Purpose: The purpose for this action is to get a full accounting of all people with access permissions and passwords, identify any who should be removed from such access, identify roles for such access that are either not being fully filled (or alternatively are overfilled), and to better facilitate the Coordinating Committee granting orderly access permissions and passwords to Green Party officials and volunteers who need that access to fulfill their Party duties and functions.

A discussion was had regarding the basis for request in terms of what is and is not happening in a timely fashion and we need a full list get it in front of us and review it and it might help fill in gaps in terms of who is available to do things.  There are some old names on some of the lists of administrators that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t with the party anymore.  Some people are listed as administrators who have no access or permission to manage the pages for which they are listed.  There was a discussion regarding the need for a volunteer on the IT Committee to do the administration of content.  There was a discussion about whether the request for the list included a time limit and it was recommended that Bert and Ajai work behind the scenes and raise the issue at the IT meeting to develop (but not publish any sensitive information from) the requested list at the next monthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CC Meeting.

There are no outstanding questions or concerns.

Approved by consensus.

Application for IT Committee

Hello,

I would like to apply to be on the IT Committee for the Green Party of California. I am currently serving as the media coordinator for the Oakland and Alameda county Greens and would like to also contribute at the state level. I believe I could represent the concerns of my city and county and could help update the GPCA website and other materials as needed.

I am a freelance web designer/developer and graphic designer and am very active on social media. I have recently redesigned the Oakland Greens and Alameda County websites and have developed logos and flyers for the Oakland and Alameda County chapters.Ã‚  In college, I lived in several cooperatives that made decisions using the consensus process. I believe very strongly in the values of the Green Party and would like to contribute at the state level.

Thank you for your consideration,

IT Roster Draft

MOST URGENT QUESTIONS

[A]
Who can provide the new SGA Vote Administrators with all the capabilities they need? (This draft list was first emailed to the CC, on September 6, 11:33 am from Laura Wells.) 

Here is a starter list of questions that will allow us to create procedures, a process for gaining access to the system, and training needed by the incoming SGA Vote Administrators. The last question applies to almost all others: who performs each of the tasks now, and who can provide the new admins with access to each of the processes?

(1) How is the list of SGA delegates updated? 
http://sga.cagreens.org/vote/contacts?cid=13

(2) How are SGA delegates added to the SGA email list, gpca-votes@cagreens.org (or gpca-votes@lists.cagreens.org)?

(3) How are SGA delegates added to the SGA voting pages/voting system? 

(4) How do proposal pages get published on the website?

(5) How do candidate lists get published on the website? How do candidate applications/bios get published and updated?

(6) How are the SGA announcements set up? Announcements include the beginning of the discussion and voting periods, the upcoming end of the voting period, and the ending of the voting period.

(7) How are the results announced for yes/no votes and for ranked choice votes?

(8) Who does each of the above, and who can provide the new admins with access to each of the above?

(9) What else should be included on this list of questions?

NOTE that in researching the GP-US voting system, it appears that â€œVote Administratorsâ€ are called "Floor Managers" and the job rotates among the Steering Committee members, with some duties performed by the Secretary of the Steering Committee. The system was described as a process of filling out ("plugging in") the software forms online: checking boxes for kind of vote, discussion period, listing candidates; and pasting in proposals, background, resources required, references. Itâ€™s possible that the CA system, which apparently was originally based on the same system as the national, may have become more complicated over the years, but still do-able by people who are not necessarily highly technical.

Appendix O
=======================


I am submitting this late item because it is urgent and just arose as an issue in the past week. The item is a decision to oppose stealth bills attacking local Community Choice clean energy programs and California renewables in general, which will be voted on by the middle of September, and on which we must take action to oppose as soon as possible in order to have a timely impact on the state legislature. 

DECISION: GPCA Opposition of California Bills &amp; Amendments Attacking Clean Energy in California 

- AB 726 (Holden) a bill that would privatize and regionalize California's electricity grid and turn it over to the influence of the coal industry and the Trump administration.

-  AB 813 (Holden) a bill requiring California monopoly utilities (PG&amp;E, SCE, SDG&amp;E) to purchase long term renewable energy contracts; which will unnecessarily raise the cost of renewables, and result in damaging costs which will undermine Community Choice energy programs.

- Community Choice 'Freeze' - Rumors have arisen that a last minute amendment may be inserted in an energy bill to freeze all new creation of Community Choice clean energy programs, which would crush the local clean energy movement in California.

BACKGROUND: California Assemblymember Chris Holden (D - Pasadena) who has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the monopoly utility corporations and their ally electrical building trades, has just introduced both AB 726 and AB 813 as 'gut-and-amend' stealth attacks on renewable energy and Community Choice clean energy programs - in the last two weeks of the California legislative session.

AB 726 would force our nonprofit California electrical grid operator (the CAISO) to partner with Warren Buffet's for profit Pacificorp (which sells coal based electricity) to create a privatized multistate regional grid operator that would allow the coal industry to re-enter the California electricity market. Buffet has directly attacked renewables in other states. This would potentially give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Trump administration the ability to leverage a resurgence of coal in the California electricity market.

AB 813 would require the monopoly utility corporations to purchase long term contracts for renewable energy ostensibly to take advantage of Federal tax credits that may expire soon. But because the cost of renewables are consistently and dramatically declining over time, the practical result of AB 813 will be to raise (not lower) the price of renewables thereby slowing down the installation of renewables in California. Because the monopoly utility corporations are allowed to pass the cost of such overpriced renewable electricity to Community Choice programs, the bill will also cause serious financial harm to these local community based clean energy programs and their ability to compete with the for profit monopoly utilities.

PROPOSAL TEXT: The GPCA Coordinating Committee resolves that the GPCA strongly opposes AB 726 and 813 (Holden - 2017) and any bill or amendment placing restrictions on the expansion of Community Choice) because these bills will increase the costs of renewables in California, threaten to return coal power to California, and add unacceptable and serious financial burdens to, and possibly even kill, California's Community Choice energy programs. The GPCA CC authorizes a letter to be sent to the state legislature opposing these bills and amendments with text similar to the following:

The Green Party of California writes to voice our strong opposition to AB 726 and 813, as well as any bills or amendments that would freeze, or otherwise limit the expansion of Community Choice clean energy programs. AB 726 would privatize the California electricity grid and allow cheap coal electricity to re-enter the California market, thereby threatening renewables, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. AB 813 would raise the costs of renewable electricity and so seriously undermine the ability of community based clean energy programs to provide low cost renewables to Californians. And any freeze on Community Choice programs would crush the community based clean energy movement in California.

At a time when the climate crisis is hammering our state and our country with record heat, fires, flooding and hurricanes, these bills unacceptably endanger with higher costs and fossil fuel energy competition, the viability of Californiaâ€™s most important response to the climate crisis; its Community Choice renewable energy programs.

California has largely removed coal power from its electricity grid and is leading the national shift to replace fossil fuel based electricity with renewable electricity. Allowing the coal industry to gain influence over our California electricity grid and re-introduce cheap coal power to California through AB 726 would be a disastrous step backward in California's clean energy progress.

Though the price of solar, wind and battery storage has been consistently and dramatically declining each year, AB 813 would foolishly force the monopoly utilities to buy renewable energy in long term contracts, which even with current federal subsidies, are likely to be higher in price than the price of renewables in even the next few years, let alone decades covered by these contracts. This foolish requirement would raise the cost of renewable energy and slow down its adoption, and would unacceptably raise costs on our local Community Choice programs because the monopoly utilities are able to pass on the cost of overly expensive renewables contracts to Community Choice customers.

Community Choice programs have been consistently delivering less expensive and cleaner electricity to customers than the private utilities. Crippling these successful community based programs with added costs, restrictions on expanding, and cheap out-of-state fossil fuel energy competition will slow down the adoption of clean energy, and cut the legs out from under crucially needed green jobs development.

AB 726 and 813, and any freeze or limitation of Community Choice expansion, would all raise the costs and lower the competitiveness of California's clean energy industry and community based clean energy programs, and deeply undercut green jobs.

We strongly urge you to OPPOSE AB 726 and 813, and to oppose any bills or amendments that would freeze or limit the expansion of Community Choice clean energy programs."

Subject:  Decision Item: Addition to March 2017 Draft Minutes from General Assembly in Kern County

Sponsors:  Mimi Newton, Bylaws Co-Co and Liaison to Coordinating Committee, on behalf of the Bylaws Committee 

Background and Purpose:  The Kern County General Assembly took place on March 11 and 12, 2017.  A Bylaws Amendment was approved at the GA without being reviewed in advance by the Bylaws Committee.  As a result, the Bylaws Committee held a Special Meeting on September 9, 2017, during which the Committee resolved to make the following recommendation to the CC: 

In two places in the draft Minutes from the March 2017 GA, where the proposed bylaws amendment was added to the agenda and where it was voted upon, the CC should consider adding the following note:

"After the General Assembly was concluded, the following section of GPCA Bylaws was brought to the attention of the Bylaws Committee, as this proposal was not submitted to the Bylaws Committee and was not reviewed by the Bylaws Committee before it was presented to the General Assembly:

GPCA Bylaw 13-2.2 -- Each proposed amendment must be submitted to the Bylaws Committee. The Bylaws Committee shall review the proposed amendments and provide recommendations to the sponsors, including to promote consistency in numbering, format, terminology and meaning with existing documents, to minimize ambiguity and to promote clarify."

Proposal:  That the CC decide whether to add the foregoing note to the draft GA Minutes from March 2017, which are expected to be posted for a vote by the SGA on October 2, 2017.

Implementation/Timeline/Resources:  Notetaker and SGA Vote Administrators to follow up in accordance with decision by the CC in time for Minutes, as amended, to be posted.
