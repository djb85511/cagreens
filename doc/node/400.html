<p align="justify"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>History of the Ad Hoc Committee on State Structure and Process<br />At the July 1992 statewide meeting of the Green Party of California (GPCA), the plenary council established an Ad Hoc Committee to “conduct an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the state level structure and process, and present any recommended changes in state structure and process, the state coordinating committee, and the state plenary... and present an implementation process.” The resolution document stated that “Background concerns expressed the need for: restructuring of the state coordinating committee; concerns for the lack of efficiency and breakdown in process, in the work and communication of many of the state working groups; question of the state meetings ...(effectiveness) for the party’s needs...; and more clarification/definition of duties and responsibilities on the state level positions.”</p>
<p align="justify">At the July 1992 statewide meeting, a signup list was circulated. Locals were invited to submit names of interested people to the committee The initial list had 17 names.</p>
<p>On August 6, the committee sent out an initial mailing asking each member to write about A) the state mission, B) the problems, and C) solutions, and sent that to all the other committee members.</p>
<p>The committee met in September in Monterey, in October in Davis, in December and January in Fresno, and in February in Davis. Dennis Bottum and Leni Ortenburger were picked to be the committee co-coordinators. The committee was diverse and had lots of differing opinions. Some of the original volunteers dropped out by not participating in the meetings and/or not doing homework.</p>
<p><b>Internal Process of the Ad Hoc Restructuring Committee</b><br />We have attempted to apply to our own work the same philosophy we think should be applied to all statewide working groups. We met in between state plenary meetings and required attendance at meetings. Members were given assignments and were required to complete them. We mailed written work to each other between meeting. We mailed minutes of meetings to each member to help with the next stage of work. We made a point or respecting each others work as well as each other as persons, sometimes in spite of our disagreements.</p>
<p>We utilized a spiral approach in our discussion and decision-making by brainstorming and listing problem areas, needs, etc.; then consolidating those lists into more general categories, which helped depersonalize the issues raised; making it easier for the group to move forward and not get bogged down in personal defensiveness. Our process enabled us to work toward a proposal that embodied the best from our various points of view. We sought consensus and rarely voted.</p>
<p><b>EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL</b></p>
<p><b>Committees</b><br />Stabilized membership will lead to greater group and individual productivity and sustainability.<br />Committee goals and process will be clearly defined.<br />Higher quality work will bring greater respect and decisions will have a lasting impact.<br />Membership becomes special.<br />Member status reflects commitment, so visitors (observers) have different status.<br />Committee work will be better documented.</p>
<p><b>State Coordinating Committee (CC)</b><br />CC empowered to limit the agenda of statewide plenary sessions so that proposals will be thoroughly considered. CC empowered to do tasks which the GPCA needs, such as hiring a Secretary. Enhanced statewide communications and networking. A balanced and reliable proposal process.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Plenary Council (PC)</b><br />Providing text of proposals in advance will lead to informed plenary decisions. Continuity of PC membership and participation will bring a stronger sense of community in the delegates. Delegates will have a voting process that insures that observers will not vote.</p>
<p><b>Proposal on Committees</b></p>
<p>Creating more effective Working Groups- what isn't working with the Working Groups?: To be successful, working groups need to be able to plan, develop, implement and manage projects, especially long-term projects. Most GPCA working groups, with a few exceptions, have been unable to do this. Many don't have a clear vision of their mission or what they want to do. Many begin projects but don't complete them. Working groups may start out with much enthusiasm but it often dissipates, and they either begin anew, change direction, or simply dissolve.</p>
<p>In evaluating what is and isn't "working" with respect to working groups, the main problems we identified were the unwieldy size of some working groups, and the fact that the membership of committees is constantly fluctuating, creating uncertainty as to who the members of the committee actually are, and making continuity of work and decision-making nearly impossible. In addition, the short time committees have to meet at statewide meetings, if that is the only time they are meeting, virtually ensures that little if any work will be accomplished. Clearly, this situation cannot continue if we hope to become an effective political organization.</p>
<p>Our primary goal for the working groups was to create a structure suitable for the Party's needs at the present time, in which committee size and membership would be stabilized; committee size would not climb to an unwieldy number, and membership on each committee would be known and posted. Within the constraints necessitated by the needs of committees for a stabilization of size and membership, we sought a model which would maximize participation without creating too many limitations. Noting that the root words of "committee" or "working group" are "commit" and "work", we sought a model in which personal responsibility for fulfilling a commitment of time and energy is the main criterion for committee membership, and in which members are held accountable for their commitments. We felt it essential that each working group spell out in writing what their specific mission is and what the expectations are of individual members, and evaluate their progress in regular written reports to the GPCA Plenary Council.</p>
<p>This area of our report took up more time than any other in our discussions. We had many different viewpoints and sought the best solutions, solutions which would not only address the problems we had identified, but also be practical to implement for our organization at the present time. With these considerations in mind, the Ad Hoc Committee on State Structure and Process proposes the following:</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Committee Responsibilities between State Meetings</b><br />It is absolutely necessary for the committees to meet and do their work between statewide meetings (a few committees already do this), rather than trying to get work done there. Rather than trying to get work done at statewide meetings, committees would use this time for orientation of prospective members and observers, and/or discussion and brainstorming sessions. Orientation sessions would be led by committee coordinators and would inform interested persons about the purpose (charter) and current activities of the committee. If the committee is bringing a proposal to the plenary session, final preparations for its presentation might also occur during statewide meetings, and some portion of the committee's meeting time might be limited to the voting members of the committee for this purpose if they felt it necessary.In recognition of meeting time constraints, oral presentations by committees to the plenary session would be made only if the committee has some proposal or action item for consideration by the plenary body.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Documentation Required of Working Groups</b><br />All working groups would be required to keep a notebook of written minutes as a record of their meetings. committees would also be required to make regular written reports of their work and progress, to be included along with the minutes of the plenary session in the packets mailed out to the locals by the C.C. (already required by our by-laws, but unenforced). committee coordinators would be responsible for maintaining committee records, including a membership list, and ensuring that information was regularly forwarded to the C.C., either directly or via the C.C.'s liaison to the committee</p>
<p><strong>Size of Working Groups</strong> Each committee would have a minimum number of 5 voting members, and a maximum number of 15; the number of associates (see below) would be unlimited. Membership would be open until filled, i.e. until the maximum number is reached. A committee would remain filled until a vacancy occurred. The maximum number of voting members for a given committee could be increased on a case-by-case basis (provided there was some justification for doing so) by making such a proposal to the plenary for approval. committee coordinators would have the responsibility of maintaining the membership roster and a waiting list for vacancies, and of keeping the C.C. and the plenary informed as to the membership status (filled/open) of the committee.</p>
<p><strong>Committee Members </strong>Committee membership would be based on commitment to doing the work and attending working group meetings. This commitment would be formally expressed by having all members (including coordinators) sign a "agreement", which would:</p>
<p>a) A statement that the basic responsibilities of committee members are to attend committee meetings (accept for just cause), and to carry out the work for which they are responsible.<br />b) A description of any additional responsibilities or expectations the committee may have of its members.<br />c) A description of the work of the committee (a copy of the committee’s charter may be attached to the agreement).<br />d) A statement that failure to meet the responsibilities of membership is grounds for removal as a member of the committee. State that the responsibility to attend meetings and to complete work are the conditions of voting membership.<br />e) A term ending date<br />Performance of work would thus become a matter of personal responsibility in fulfilling group agreements. Committees will take into account the financial situation of members, and the fact that some members may be physically unable to travel when meeting locations are chosen. Committees should, if possible, provide financial assistance to members who would not otherwise be able to attend meetings.</p>
<p>It is the intent that this process, in which people agree (in writing) to take on certain responsibilities, will lend a sense of empowerment to the committees. Then it is a more serious consideration to sign up for a committee, and not just a matter of putting one's name on a sign -in sheet that goes around the room.</p>
<p>The membership list would become information available to all GP members, typed up, posted on GPCA internal electronic conferences, given to the C.C., etc., so that GP members would know who is responsible for the work being done by that committee, whom to contact, etc. A voting member could decline to have their address/phone/email distributed publicly, but voting members would still need at least a mailing address for each other in order to mail reports and assignments between meetings.</p>
<p><b>Removal Clause for Members </b></p>
<p>As mentioned above, there would be a removal clause in voting members' agreements. committee coordinators would keep track of members' attendance and work assignments. At the beginning of each meeting, the status of the membership roster would be addressed and clarified; if the status of any particular member is an issue, then this would be resolved before other business.</p>
<p>If a voting member fails to fulfill their agreement, they may be removed by a decision of the other members (2/3 vote, as already specified in the by-laws. Members would, of course, be permitted to miss a meeting now and then, provided they had just cause and had notified one of the coordinators prior to the meeting.</p>
<p><b>Decision-Making in Committee Meetings </b></p>
<p>Decision-making in meetings, setting the agenda, etc. would be done by the voting members of the committee only (as already specified in our by-laws). Participation in decision-making is thus tied to commitment and responsibility; it is a right earned by full engagement with the committee and its work.</p>
<p><b>Terms for Voting Members </b></p>
<p>Members of committees would serve 1 year terms from the time their signed agreements are accepted by the committee coordinators. Serving out one's term is subject to fulfilling one’s responsibilities as a member. A natural staggering should occur as members leave and new members sign on. Members may serve up to four consecutive 1-year terms, after which they may continue to serve for six-month extension intervals so long as the committee is not filled and there are no prospective members waiting to join. If there are others interested in serving, members whose terms have expired must rotate off for a at least one year before they may rejoin. If the member rotating off is still interested in the work of the committee, s/he can become an "associate" of the committee, or may wish to join another committee which has a vacancy. To foster greater participation, a person may serve on no more than two committees at time (including the CC).</p>
<p><b>Associates and Observers</b></p>
<p>People interested in the work of the committee, who have some time and energy to give, but could not necessarily commit to full attendance and participation, could still assist in the committee's work by becoming "associates" of the committee. They would not be required to sign agreements, but their attendance and any work performed would be recorded by the coordinators. Associates might also be those who are interested in becoming members of the committee; associates would be the first group from which new members are sought when a vacancy occurs, since they will already be somewhat familiar with the committee's work and progress.</p>
<p>Observers would be welcome at committee meetings. They would be required to sign in, along with associates and members.</p>
<p>Amount and time for associate and observer input during meetings would be at the discretion of the committee members, however some amount of time must be allotted for such input. Formal discussion (with facilitation and stacking) may be limited to voting members, with associates participating during open discussion or brainstorming periods. Observer comments may be limited to a specified block of time, for example at the beginning or ending of the meeting. The committee membership has the right to exclude from meeting participation individuals whose behavior is disruptive or obstructing the committee's work.</p>
<p><b>Filling Vacancies in an Established Working Group: </b></p>
<p>Once a committee is filled, vacancies might arise due to:</p>
<p>1) members losing interest/dropping out/moving away, etc.<br />2) members' terms expiring<br />3) members being removed</p>
<p>The coordinators would maintain a list of people interested in being on the committee, essentially a waiting list for vacancies. After attending a committee orientation at a statewide meeting, persons interested in becoming associate or voting members would sign a statement of interest form, which would be dated and kept on file by the committee coordinators. Vacancies in all committees would be filled by the membership.</p>
<p>Associates are the first group from which new members are sought. Prior involvement in the work of the committee (including attendance at meetings) be the main criteria by which new members are selected, based on the records maintained by the committee coordinators. This factor being equal among several associates, diversity in the composition of the committee and relevant experience (if applicable to a specific need of the committee) are the additional criteria. Length of time on the waiting list will be the next factor considered, all other criteria being equal.</p>
<p><b>Responsibilities of committee Co-Coordinators </b><br />Committee Co-coordinators would be responsible for the establishment of agendas for all committee meetings, for facilitating the assignment of committee tasks and responsibilities, and for coordinating the activities of the committee between meetings. Committee Co-coordinators would take a roll-call at the beginning of each meeting, and track attendance. They would also keep track of tasks assigned or volunteered for, and whether they were completed. By means of these attendance and performance records, they would maintain and update the membership roster for their committee. They would be responsible for keeping on file all signed agreements of members, keeping members informed as to expiration of terms, and accepting signed agreements from new members.Co-Coordinators will provide to the C.C. a current contact list of all voting members of the committee, and an updated list will be provided after every meeting when there is a change in membership or contact information. Coordinators will provide the C.C. with a copy of the minutes of each committee meeting, by mailing them to the C.C. liaison within 3 weeks after the meeting. They will also be responsible for filing regular written committee reports to the C.C., including a report as to the membership status of the committee (filled/open). The Co-Coordinators will maintain a waiting list for committee vacancies, based on signed and dated statement-of-interest forms. They will be responsible for providing an orientation during statewide meetings about the charter and current work of the committee, and providing statement-of-interest forms to prospective members. In addition to their agreements as voting members, coordinators will sign a committee coordinator's agreement outlining their additional responsibilities.</p>
<p><b>Committee Co-Coordinators’ Terms </b><br />Coordinators would have the same overall terms as other committee members, but would serve 1-year terms as coordinators. They could continue for as many as four 1-year terms as coordinators, subject to reconfirmation by a vote of the members at the end of each one-year period. Working groups would select their own coordinators; they must be voting members of the committee when chosen. It is up to each committee if they wish to add additional qualifications for coordinators. For the transition phase (see below), committees would start out with the current coordinators, unless they do not wish to continue, in which case an internal election of coordinators could take place during the transition phase.</p>
<p><b>The Transition Phase</b><br />We feel it is necessary to have a clean, clear break between the old and the new. To accomplish this, we envision a 4-step Transition Phase to implement this plan for stabilizing each working group and defining its membership.</p>
<p>In keeping with our current by-laws, all committees must have a charter or mission statement ratified by the plenary council in order to be an officially recognized committee of the GPCA, empowered to present and advocate proposals. We are also proposing that ad-hoc committees be required to have a written mission statement ratified by the plenary council. Therefore, the first tasks of each committee are defining its membership, writing a charter/mission statement, and submitting the charter to the plenary council for approval. The steps for implementing this transition phase and accomplishing these tasks would be as follows:</p>
<p><b>Step 1. Set-Up/First Transition Meeting </b><br />At the first statewide meeting at which (or after which) these proposals are adopted (we could both approve and begin to implement the plan at the next statewide meeting), the current committee coordinators would conduct a setup meeting. At this meeting they would present a history of the committee and facilitate a discussion of the committee's mission and objectives. They would also explain what the new expectations for committee membership are, hand out statement-of-interest forms and sample copies of agreements, and work with the rest of the group to set a meeting date and place for the second transition meeting. All persons interested in becoming voting members of the committee would be required to attend both transition meetings, which would occur before the next statewide meeting. Homework may also be assigned. Attendance at both transition meetings is required of all persons interested in becoming the initial members of the committee.</p>
<p><b>Step 2. Second Transition Meeting </b><br />At the second transition meeting, those in attendance will work on the written charter (statement of purpose/mission) to be submitted to the plenary council for ratification, select coordinators, turn in written agreements, and prepare a roster of the committee’s membership based on signed agreements, attendance at both transition meetings, and completion of homework (if applicable). The membership roster must be at least 5 members and no more than 15. Coordinators will ensure that the C.C&gt; receives a copy of both the membership roster and the charter statement (if completed) immediately after this meetings. Completion of the charter statement should be timed so that a copy of each committee’s charter goes out in the delegate packet prior to the next statewide meeting; the second transition meeting will have to be timed accordingly, with this goal in mind. Committees will also set a date and place for their next meeting.</p>
<p>What happens if there are more than 15 people interested in being on a particular committee? With more clearly defined expectations of committee members and the signing of a agreement to that effect, the chances are that less people will be interested in becoming committee members than the numbers we see signing sign-in sheets at committee meetings now. Most of these people are functioning as observers rather than members -- membership has never been clarified, which is what we are attempting to address. There is every likelihood that the committees will not be filled initially. If there are more than 15 prospective members who have attended both transition meetings and are prepared to sign agreements, the committee (effectively all those who have fulfilled membership requirements as of the 2nd Transition meeting) will have to solve this dilemma as a group: attendance criteria being equal, some people may be willing to stand aside and become associates for the time being. If not, an internal election will be held. Persons voting will be those who have fulfilled membership requirements thus far. Again, it is doubtful that this situation will even arise, but this way of handling it would only apply in the initial transition phase to a stabilized membership. Once the committee membership is established for the first time, future vacancies will be handled in a different manner (see Filling Vacancies in an Established Committee above).</p>
<p>The Next Statewide Meeting Before the next statewide meeting, the committees will present their written charters to the Cc for inclusion in the pre-meeting delegates agenda packets, prior to presenting their charters to the Plenary Council. Committees are not officially recognized by the GPCA until their charters have been approved by the plenary body, to be incorporated into the by-laws (current by-laws already call for this). Proposals will only be heard from committees whose charters/mission statements have been approved by the Plenary Council of the GPCA.This would mean that by the end of the statewide meeting following the Transition Phase, the committee membership will have been formally established for the first time. Time permitting, the committees will also have been officially recognized by the Plenary Council by means of ratification of their charter statements. The membership roster, along with coordinator's names and phone numbers, will be passed on to the locals via their regional representatives on the C.C.; they will also be posted on GPCA internal electronic conferences.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br />It is important to note that many aspects of this proposal closely follow our current GPCA By-Laws, but certain additions should help to strengthen our structure by removing some of the nebulousness. For example, current GPCA By-laws state that "committees may control their own membership with respect to the number of members, the skills of members, and the performance of members, as may be required to meet the needs of the committee." (Article VII, Section 4.1). In practice, this kind of vagueness has created problems. This proposal to stabilize committee membership makes the number more specific, applies itself equally to all committees, and by adding a agreement (with terms) between the member and the committee, clarifies both the committee's expectations and the members' agreement to take on certain responsibilities. Rather than a category of "inactive members" (Art.VII, Sec.4.2), this plan creates a category of "associates" or friends of the committee. One is either a voting member of the committee or not, and the status of the membership roster is a topic addressed before every meeting. Additionally, the committee coordinators are given the responsibility of tracking attendance and work performance, essentially ensuring that the agreement is fulfilled; they are empowered to do so by the committee which has chosen them, with the support and full involvement of the other members of the working group. By contrast, current by-laws, although stating that attendance and performance are the requirements of committee membership, provide neither a means of expressing one's commitment, nor do they specify who is responsible for keeping track of this information and maintaining the membership roster. Under our current by-laws, empowerment in decision-making within a committee is limited to active members of that committee, and limitations on participation in committee discussions are also at the discretion of the active members, so these things are also not new. (See Art.VII, Sect. 5.1 and 6.1) The requirement that a charter or statement of purpose must be ratified for every committee by the Plenary Council is also straight out of our by-laws, (Art.VII, Sect. 3.1), as is the requirement that proposals be presented by one of the duly recognized GPCA committees (Art.VI, Sect. 8.1 and 9.2). Perhaps most importantly, by altering our process so that committee work is undertaken between statewide meetings, not during them, this proposal squarely faces the fact that effective working groups, which we are relying upon to do the state-level work of the GPCA, must get serious about undertaking that work, and cannot continue to hold the unreasonable expectation of accomplishing all that they need to do in a 2-hour meeting held twice or three times a year. Using statewide meeting time to hold orientation sessions for committees serves an important function in attracting and informing potential new members of committees and other interested persons.</p>
<p><b>Therefore, the changes and additions suggested by the committee are:</b><br />1) committees will meet and conduct their business between statewide meetings. Statewide meeting time will be used for:</p>
<p>a) Orientation of prospective members and observers<br />b) Discussion or brainstorming sessions<br />c) Final preparations for presentation of proposals. (Some portion of this part of the committee's meeting time may be limited to voting members if they feel it necessary).</p>
<p>2) Oral presentations by committees at statewide meetings will occur only if they have some proposal or action item for considera-tion by the plenary body.</p>
<p>3) All committees are required to make regular written reports of their work and progress, to be submitted to the C.C. for inclusion with the minutes of the statewide meeting.</p>
<p>4) All committees are required to keep written minutes of their committee meetings as a record of their work. committee coordinators will ensure that a notebook of the minutes is kept on hand for the committee and brought to each meeting, and that a copy goes to the C.C. via the liaison following each meeting.</p>
<p>5) Each committee will have a minimum number of 5 voting members and a maximum of 15. Membership is open until filled. There is no limit on the number of associates. A committee’s size may be increased beyond the maximum requires the approval of the plenary council in each case, provided there is some justification for doing so, such as increased work load. committee reports must include a report on the membership status of the committee (i.e. whether filled/open).</p>
<p>6) Voting membership is based on a commitment to doing the work assigned or expected, plus regular attendance at all committee meetings. With respect to meeting attendance, committees will take into account the financial situation of members, and the fact that some members may be physically unable to travel when meeting locations are chosen. Committees should, if possible, provide financial assistance to members who would not otherwise be able to attend meetings.</p>
<p>7) A committee member expresses their commitment to full involvement with a committee by signing a written agreement, to include</p>
<p>a) A statement that the basic responsibilities of committee members are to attend committee meetings (accept for just cause), and to carry out the work for which they are responsible.<br />b) A description of any additional responsibilities or expectations the committee may have of its members.<br />c) A description of the work of the committee (a copy of the committee’s charter may be attached to the agreement).<br />d) A statement that failure to meet the responsibilities of membership is grounds for removal as a member of the committee.<br />State that the responsibility to attend meetings and to complete work are the conditions of voting membership.<br />e) A term ending date</p>
<p>8) The names of the members of each committee shall be information available to all GPCA members.</p>
<p>9) The committee membership may remove (by a 2/3 vote) any member who fails to fulfill their written agreement. At the beginning of each committee meeting, the status of the membership roster will be addressed; if the status of any particular member is an issue, this will be resolved before other business.</p>
<p>10) Decision-making in meetings, setting the agenda, etc. is done by the voting members of the committee only.</p>
<p>11) Terms for committee members will be one year. Serving out one's term is subject to fulfilling one’s responsibilities as a member. Members may serve up to four consecutive 1-year terms. They may continue to serve for 6-month extension intervals thereafter, as long as the committee is not filled and there are no prospective members waiting to join the committee. If others are waiting, members whose terms have expired must rotate off for a period of at least one year.</p>
<p>12) To promote greater participation, individuals may serve on no more than two committees at a time.</p>
<p>13) Committees will have associates. Associates are those either:</p>
<p>a) interested in helping with the committee's work but cannot commit to full attendance and participation or<br />b) engaged to some degree with the work of the committee and are on a waiting list to serve as voting members. Associates are not required to sign agreements, but their attendance and work will be recorded by committee coordinators, to be used as the main criteria in filling vacancies.</p>
<p>14) Both associates and observers are welcome at committee meetings. Associate and observer input at committee meet-ings may be limited (at the discretion of the members of the committee), but some amount of time must be allotted for such input.</p>
<p>15) The committee membership has the right to exclude from meeting participation individuals whose behavior is disruptive or obstructing the group's work.</p>
<p>16) Persons interested in becoming voting members or associates of a committee must attend a committee orientation at a statewide meeting, and complete a statement-of-interest form, to be given to the committee coordinators. Coordinators will keep these forms on file as part of a waiting list.</p>
<p>17) Associates have priority in filling committee vacancies. Associates' prior attendance and work performed for the committee will be the main criteria by which new members are selected. This criteria being equal among several associates, diversity in the composition of the committee and relevant experience (if applicable to a specific need of the committee) are the additional criteria. Length of time on the waiting list will be the next factor considered, all other criteria being equal.</p>
<p>18) In addition to signing a agreement as a voting member, committee coordinators will sign an additional agreement defining their responsibilities as coordinators. Their responsibili-ties will be to:</p>
<p>a) Establish agendas for all committee meetings.<br />b) Facilitate the assignment of committee tasks and responsibilities.<br />c) Coordinate the activities of the committee between meetings.<br />d) Take a roll-call at the beginning of each meeting.<br />e) Record attendance and work performance of members and associates.<br />f) Maintain committee records, including membership list, minutes, waiting list, reports, etc.<br />g) Update membership roster at the beginning of each meeting; provide updated lists to the C.C.<br />h) Accept signed agreements and keep them on file.<br />i) Provide the C.C. liaison with copies of meeting minutes.<br />j) File regular, written reports with the C.C. to be included in statewide meeting minutes, including a report on the membership status of the committee (i.e. filled/open).<br />k) Maintain a waiting list for vacancies.<br />l) Conduct orientations at statewide meetings; provide statement-of-interest forms to prospective members.<br />m) Present committee proposals to the plenary council.<br />n) Maintain communication with C.C. via liaison; coordinate and communicate with other committees as necessary.<br />o) Attend state committee coordinator's meetings<br />p) Take an active role in the development of the committee, including encouraging and supporting other committee members and associates.</p>
<p>19) committees will select their own coordinators; they must be members of the committee when chosen. committees may add additional qualifications for coordinators. Committee coordinators may not also be members of the C.C.</p>
<p>20) committee coordinators will have the same overall terms as other voting members, but will serve 1-year terms as coordinators. They may serve up to four 1-year terms as coordinators, subject to reconfirmation by a vote of the members at the end of each 1-year period.</p>
<p>21) To present proposals to the Plenary Council, a committee must be an officially recognized committee of the GPCA, i.e. they must have a written charter, which has been ratified by the Plenary Council of the general assembly.</p>
<p>22). Ad Hoc Committees must have a written mission statement, approved by the plenary council, in order to present proposals at a statewide meeting.<br /> </p>
