Hi,
I wanted to submit the following requested changes to the
draft election code in writing, to follow up on my statement at the
plenary.

7879 - the last part of this section (starting with "However, county
Greeen Parties...") deals with letting counties set their own CC
size.  This should probably be split out from the rest of 7879, and
moved before 7878, which describes the default CC size (and uses
a really bizzare formula, IMO).  In SF, the default formula only
gives us 9 members, vs the DCCC which has 25!  We lose a lot of
bar fights with them as a result.

7941 - some people should be able to be appointed to CCs who aren't
eligible to register Green: non-citizens, youth, etc.  Suggest adding
the wording ", or lives in that county but is legally unable to
register to vote".  Another delegate objected to this language,
suggesting it's illegal, but I think the question of appointed local
officials is separate to who can run for election (or vote).  Therefore,
it may be illegal to run for CC as a noncitizen, but it shouldn't
be illegal to appoint a noncitizen to a vacancy on the CC if we want.

7951 - "committee" should be replaced with "CC" and the words
"which shall be" deleted.

Thanks,
JMC
