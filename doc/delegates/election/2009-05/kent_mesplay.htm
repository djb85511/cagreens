We are representatives of more than our respective states. I agree  with the <br>    previous statement of candidate Mato Ska (aka Martin Zehr) regarding <br>    specific, basic delegate roles, namely:<br>    <br>    An NC Delegate from California needs to represent the concerns of <br>    California Greens within the National Committee both organizationally <br>    and politically; an NC delegate needs to recognize the decisions of the <br>    leadership bodies of the GPCA; an NC member needs to maintain the <br>    necessary decorum within the NC to address resolutions and proposals, <br>    sponsor them as directed by the state Green Party and make proposals <br>    that can be reviewed by state and county bodies of the party; an NC <br>    member needs to support the campaign efforts of the Presidential nominee <br>    as determined by the nominating convention of the GPUS, an NC <br>    representative needs to assure adequate representation of the needs and <br>    concerns of California Greens internally and increase the financial <br>    viability and organizational integrity of the GPUS, an NC delegate needs <br>    to work with other California state delegates in addressing proposals <br>    and resolutions before the NC; an NC delegate needs to communicate with <br>    other delegates in the review and evaluation of actions before the NC in <br>    a professional manner that upholds the integrity of the decision-making <br>    process; an NC delegate represents his or her own views in such a way as <br>    to promote unity while forthrightly representing GPCA and not <br>    sacrificing the ethical responsibility for my own individual <br>    accountability in upholding the Ten Key Values and an NC delegate needs <br>    to respect divergent views within the GPCA and the National Committee <br>    (Martin summarized our duties well).</font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
