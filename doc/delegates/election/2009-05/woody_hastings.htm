I've served as the regional director of a statewide environmental<br>non-profit, in elected office as an environmental planning deputy, for a<br>regional air quality agency as a senior public information specialist, and<br>in the private sector advancing renewable energy projects and programs. I<br>served as a Green public office holder as a Director of the Resource<br>Conservation District of the Santa Monica Mountains from 2001 to 2007 (an LA<br>County Supervisor-appointed office). I'm currently working with<br>municipalities on deployment of clean renewable fuel infrastructure for<br>municipal vehicle fleets. I serve on the Board of Directors of the<br>Riverside, CA based non-profit Clean Air Now; serve as an appointed member<br>of the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Agency's Citizens Advisory<br>Council where I have established a Sustainable Transportation Subcommittee<br>for which I serve as Chair; and serve as an appointed member of the San<br>Francisco Peak Oil Preparedness Task Force. Education: BA, Environmental<br>Studies<br>  <br>  <strong>3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing  the job description for GPUS Delegate.</strong><br>  <br>  First and foremost I want to do a good job of representing San Francisco and<br>California at large to the GPUS. I want to help develop a stable,<br>functional, efficient, responsive and accountable national Party<br>organization that gets things done; I want to help foster the development of<br>robust GPs in all fifty states; I want to help reclaim for the GP many of<br>the issues for which, in many cases, we have been the sole champions, but<br>for which we do not get credit/recognition. My intention for this term is<br>to make a renewed commitment to take part in the discussion of proposals<br>before the GPUS CC, participate in the monthly teleconferences, and attend<br>delegation meetings at State General Assemblies. </font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
