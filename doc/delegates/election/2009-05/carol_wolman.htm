Both thesecoalitions, which have some overlap, include independents, progressive Democrats,and people of other parties, so that we can work together across party lines.Most candidates are Greens.<br>I've been a peace activist for many years, organizing to save the ABM treaty(a failed effort), ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, strengthen the NonProliferationTreaty and push the US toward observing Article VI, by reducing our nuclear weaponsstockpile. <br><br>I also write extensively on the internet.

With Greens in Congress in 2010, Obama'sefforts to contain climate change and global warming would receive a big boost.</font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
