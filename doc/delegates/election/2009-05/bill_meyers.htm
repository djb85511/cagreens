I first  registered Green in 2001.<br>  <br>  I served on the Point Arena School Board from 2000 until 2008, including 2  years as board chairperson.<br>  <br>  I have served as a delegate to the National Committee a couple of times already,  so I am familiar with the responsiblities involved.<br>  <br>  I have at times been active with the Green Party of California, for instance  acting as a facilitator and serving on the Personnel Committee.<br>  <br>  I am a professional writer; most of my income comes from freelance technical  editorial work. My political works include A Brief History of the Democratic  Party and Santa Clara Blues: Corporate Personhood versus Democracy.<br>  <br>  I know that the Democratic and Republican Parties are war crimes organizations.  I know both represent a ruling class in the United States that has almost no  common interests with working people. To the extent we should work through  the currently structured representative democracy, I believe the Green Party  is the most viable alternative to the ruling class parties.<br>  <br>  I don't think my vision is very different from most people who are active in  the Green Party. I know being on the National Committee is not glamorous. It  is mostly grunt work.<br>   <br>  2009-2010 are years in which the American people are likely to see the true  nature of the Democratic Party. I hope we can show them that the Green Party  is a viable alternative for hope and change.</font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
