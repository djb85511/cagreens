I have served on the County Council of Alameda County for  two terms, as a delegate to the state plenaries, and as an organizer for the  local chapter in the City of Alameda. I have previously assisted the Alameda  County treasurer during his absences from the county. I attended the national  party convention as a California delegate in 2000 (Denver).<br>  <br>  I have been active in the struggles for peace and justice, anti-apartheid,  poor people&#8217;s movement, health care reform for single payer, and electoral  reform. I served as treasurer for San Francisco Neighbor-to-Neighbor for the  Proposition 186 campaign for single payer health care in 1994. I worked as  a Community Organizer for the California Nurses Association from 1996 &#8211; 2002,  assisting in numerous collective bargaining, legislative and regulatory campaigns.  I participated in anti-toxics work with the Toxic Links Coalition and its constituent  groups, and helped to shut down the medical waste incinerator on High Street  (Oakland), in 2001. I was supportive of the Green Party's campaigns: Audie  Bock for State Assembly, Nader 2000 and Rebecca Kaplan's run for Oakland City  Council in the same election. I have served several terms as a member of the  Restoration Advisory Board for the clean-up at Alameda Point (formerly Alameda  Naval Base) from 1999 - 2004.<br>  <br>  I am currently employed as an Assistant Professor of Nursing at Samuel Merritt  University and practice nursing with a home health agency. I see my role as  an alternate as a way to contribute my time, vision, and strategic experience  toward the growth of the party at the national level, particularly in the area  of health care reform.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>        </font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
