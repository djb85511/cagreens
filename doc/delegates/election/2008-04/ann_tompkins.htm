            I have been a registered member of the Green Party for some eight
            years or more. I was an active member of the local Green Party of
            Sonoma County for approximately three years: elected as a member
            of the Coordinating Council and also served on various committees
            (as chair of some) during that time. I attended various plenary meetings,
            first in Sacramento, and subsequently as a delegate twice in Southern
            California, and once in San Francisco. I have been involved in other
            activities recently, not attending the Sonoma County Coordinator
            meetings, but maintaining friendly and supportive relations with
            those who continue to serve as coordinators and active members. I
            still follow the current GPSC news on our local list serves. <br>
            <br>
            My interest is that there be a strong and viable national body, which
            will serve to maintain accountability to membership, run a strong
            presidential campaign, and assure organizational competence with
            the broadest possible unity.<br>
