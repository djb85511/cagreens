          <p><strong>Candidate Statement</strong><br>
            <br>
            When I ran for GPUS National Committee delegate 2 years ago, I pledged
            to work to improve democratic standards within the GPUS and to get
            the GPUS to formally discard its disastrous Safe States Strategy
            of 2004 (which has cost the California Green Party 17% of our membership
            since our peak in 2003) and to affirm its right and duty to threaten
            and make demands of the corporate-funded parties. I stated, &quot;These
            2 issues are currently connected, with California's membership remaining
            disenfranchized as part of an overall trend of capitulation to the
            ploys of the Democrats. If this trend wins out, I believe the democratic
            issues will be moot, because the party will die as utterly irrelevant.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            I have kept my promises in working for those goals. For two solid
            years, I spent an unbelievable number of hours working for more proportional
            representation of the membership, as mandated by a 70% vote of the
            National Committee. I'm proud to say that we won some victories,
            although I think we ultimately lost the war. The GPUS in the end
            rejected its own mandate. (See http://darksidegp.blogspot.com/2007/12/gpus-rejects-democracy.html
            for gory details). But no one can say we didn't give our all to every
            last chance. I still hope the victories will become seeds for better
            democratic standards in the future.<br>
            <br>
            I also co-authored a national proposal (#218) to formally discard
            the Safe States Strategy and to acknowledge that one of our main
            purposes as a political party is to pose an electoral challenge to
            the corporate agenda promoted by the two corporate parties, the Democrats
            and Republicans. This proposal passed with 80% approval in 2006.
            While this did not eliminate the trend toward political cowardice
            in the party, it at least drove that trend underground and allowed
            the national party to frame the terms of the 2008 presidential race
            without the interminable, ineffectual waffling of 2003 and 2004.
            Our work in the Presidential Campaign Support Committee would have
            been severely hampered without the passage of that proposal (see
            http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=218 for text).<br>
            <br>
            I have kept my commitments to the principles and constituency I represent.
            I have often put more into it than I had to give. I can't count the
            number of all-nighters I've invested into this struggle.<br>
            <br>
            I run for re-election now with a slightly different pledge. If elected,
            I promise to continue to represent the causes of fair representation,
            accountability, and a strong electoral strategy independent of the
            corporate parties. I promise to do so until I no longer choose to
            tolerate all the contradictions, betrayals, hypocrisy and character
            assassination involved in doing so. I promise to take care of myself
            in the process. And if I assess that the time has come where further
            investment of time and energy amounts to &quot;throwing good money
            after bad,&quot; I pledge to resign and allow you to elect a new
            representative of our constituency.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, for 2008, I pledge to keep my eyes on the prize of a strong
            presidential campaign against the war. The country needs this desperately.
            The presidential race establishes the spectrum of political debate
            for the whole country and yet the view of 70% of citizens is essentially
            excluded from public consideration. The one worthwhile thing we could
            accomplish this year as a political party is to unite behind the
            strongest possible anti-war campaign. If nothing else, we have a
            duty now to be AS VISIBLE AS WE CAN in challenging the pro-war, anti-liberty
          corporate agenda. </p>
