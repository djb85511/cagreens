  <strong><br>
  </strong><font size="3"><strong>1) Please list any prior or current positions, related
  experience, and/or personal and professional skills within of the Green Party
  that you have, that apply to this position.</strong><br>
  <br>
  I have been a member of the Green
  Party since 1999 when I arrived in California. I have attended one National
  Meeting (Tucson, AZ: July 06), and two Plenaries (Moorpark: Jun 06 and South
  Lake Tahoe: Sep 06).<br>
  <br>
  I have been the California member on the <a href="http://www.gp.org/committees/brpp/">GPUS
  BRPP</a> (Bylaws, Rules Policies
  and Procedures) committee for the past year.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience,
          and/or personal and professional skills outside of the Green Party
          that you have, that apply to this position.</strong><br>
          <br>
          I have been active in the
          election process for 18 years as an election judge in Minnesota and
          an Inspector while in California. This ensures that procedures at polling
          places are followed and that an election truly represents the will
          of the people.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate
          including addressing the job description for GPUS Delegate.</strong><br>
          <br>
          Delegates
          have grave responsibilities to the citizens of California, to serve
          to the best of their abilities. <br>
          <br>
          It is incumbent upon delegates to participate
          fully in research and discussions, in debate and in reaching agreements
          that will bring a vibrant Green Party into power at the National level
          to represent every citizen of the United States.<br>
          <br>
          I will actively take part in the discussions and negotiations representing
          the Green Party of California. I will speak to the issues, listen to
        delegates from other states and seek common understandings and goals.</font></p>
