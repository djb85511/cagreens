          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am applying to
            be a California delegate to the GPUS. I would interpret my responsibility
            as a delegate to represent the will of Green voters
            of California. I am committed to transparency and democratic procedure
            and will work to ensure that the workings of the GPUS are known and
            accessible to as many Greens as possible. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            I would consider it a goal to ensure that as many Greens as possible
              are aware of the opportunity to have input to the decisions made
              by the GPUS, and that proposed changes are considered as widely
                    and deeply in the party as possible.<br>
