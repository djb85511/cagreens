          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&#8217;m running for re-election as an Alternate Delegate to the
              GPUS. I&#8217;ve served one term (two years) and have voted in
              the online elections as needed, and attended the Annual National
              Meetings
              in Tulsa (2005, as an observer), Tucson (2006), and Reading (2007).
              I am committed to attending the Presidential Nominating Convention
              in Chicago (July 2008). While I have not served on any committees
              at the GPUS level, I am on the Alameda County Council and also
              active at the Oakland level.<br>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been active in the
              movements for peace and social justice since my college days in
              the early 1960's. I started checking out the Bay Area' Green activities
in the late 1980's--I attended &quot;Greening the West&quot; (in
October
1988) and was superficially involved with the East Bay Greens in 1989-1992. I
switched registration (from Peace and Freedom to Green) during the petition drive
around 1992. In the 1990's I was also part of a class series for people from the
social justice movement who were learning
about environmental issues (&quot;From Lenin to the Lorax&quot;) which became
an ongoing learning circle throughout the 1990's, reading many books and articles
on issues of the environment and globalization--looking at environmental issues
through the lens of race, class, and gender. I also participated in anti-toxics
work with the Toxic Links Coalition and its constituent groups, and helped to
shut down the medical waste incinerator on High Street (Oakland), in 2001. Meanwhile
I was supportive of the Green Party's campaigns; Nader 1996, Dan Hamburg for
Governor 1998, Audie Bock, and then with great enthusiasm, Nader 2000 and Rebecca
Kaplan's run for City Council in the same election. <br>
<br>
Since 2000 I've taken more responsibility, tabling in Oakland, supporting the
Camejo campaigns of 2002, 2003, and 2006, running for County Council in 2004
(I've been on the Council since May 2004). In my County, I work on outreach,
the Voter Guide, and other tasks as needed. I have attended nearly all the GPCA
Plenaries since 2004. I worked on planning the 2005 Green Gathering in Oakland,
on Aimee Allison&#8217;s campaigns for City Council in 2005-2006 and on the Oak
to Ninth referendum in 2006.</font></p>

              <br>
            Since becoming an Alternate, I have been voting as needed, which
              means usually.</font></p>
