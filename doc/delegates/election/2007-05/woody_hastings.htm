  <br>
  I&#8217;m a 20+ year strategic planner, public policy analyst, community organizer
  focusing primarily on renewable energy, air quality, and solid waste-related
  issues. I&#8217;ve served as the regional director of a statewide environmental
  non-profit, in elected office as an environmental planning deputy, for a regional
  air quality agency as a senior public information specialist, and in the private
  sector advancing renewable energy projects and programs. I served as a Green
  public office holder as a Director for the Resource Conservation District of
  the Santa Monica Mountains from 2001 to 2007, a position appointed by LA County
  Supervisor. I&#8217;m currently working with municipalities on implementation
  of clean renewable alt fuel applications for municipal vehicle fleets, and
  with the San Francisco State University Department of Environmental Studies
  organizing a January 2008 &#8220;Focus The Nation&#8221; global warming summit
  conference.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing
  the job description for GPUS Delegate.</strong><br>
  <br>
  I want to act in good faith as a representative of the state and help guide
  the national party through this extended period of &#8220;growing pains.&#8221; I
  want to help develop a stable, functional, efficient, responsive and accountable
  national Party organization that gets things done. I want to help foster the
  development of robust GPs in all fifty states. I want to help reclaim for the
  GP many of the issues for which, in many cases, we have been the sole champions,
  but for which we do not get credit/recognition. The best example is global
  warming. The GP has been solid on that all along, but Al Gore, who failed to
  address it significantly while in the White House for eight years, and who
  barely mentioned it in the 2000 campaign, but was happy to talk about &#8220;clean&#8221; coal,
  has now completely captured the issue with his Inconvenient Truth film. The
  GP needs to make the effort to re-seize that issue. I want to help advance
  Ranked Choice Voting and other electoral reforms. I know that there are a lot
  of internal administrative and procedural issues like bylaws amendments, etc.
  that need to be handled by this body and I&#8217;m willing to participate in
  that process as well.</font></p>
