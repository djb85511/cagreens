  _____________________________________________________________<br>

  This email serves as my notice of availability to serve as a GPCA GPUS Delegate
  or alternate -- with the following understandings and qualifications: I am
  submitting this &quot;application&quot; with significant reluctance and reservations
  due to existing responsibilities in my GPCA work as CCWG Coordinator and an
  active ERWG participant (each of which is expected to continue for the next
  two years). Accordingly, I have serious concerns about the amount of time and
  focus I actually may have for additional GPCA commitments. I am submitting
  this application on the basis that I will agree to be a delegate or alternate
  only if filling that position is necessary to provide the GPCA delegation with
  its full complement of delegates under present or future GPUS rules.<br>
  <br>
  If I were to become a delegate or alternate, I would expect my focus to be
  as a California contact for the GPUS Coordinated Campaigns Committee. I already
  have advised Greg Gerritt and Brent McMillan that I am willing to act in that
  capacity (particularly since there is no one in the GPCA Delegation who has
  volunteered to do so for more than a year) because it seems consistent with
  my work in the CCWG. My
  expectations for the delegation are that it be able to act collectively in
  a collaborative fashion, that each delegate and alternate participate in at
  least one GPUS committee, and that the delegation (including alternates) provide
  at least one delegation liaison to each GPCA SC/WG.<br>
