  <br>
  I am an active member in good standing with the GP of Orange County. I was
  formerly elected to the county council of the same organization.<br>
  <br>
  1) I have served as an activist in the GPCA GROW WG, on the National GPAX representing
  Alabama, and as an alternate NC delegate from Alabama.<br>
  <br>
  I have coordinated outreach and many events that broadened the GPOC and green
  party&#8217;s appeal to Spanish speaking and immigrant labor.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          I have broadened outreach in the spectrum of PDA to Direct Action
                  folks not traditionally given to trusting electoral politics.
                  I have consistently advocated
    on behalf of veterans and immigrant rights, while guarding against pandering
    to chauvinism or giving into erroneous ideas that the leadership or base
                  of the green party is beyond racism, sexism, or self-criticism
                  and improvement.<br>
          <br>
    My personal and professional skills allow me to juggle many different people,
    ideas, and tendencies so that the outcome can be of the greatest benefit
    to the overall project of the ten key values.<br>
    <br>
    2) My background in union, community, and campaign organizing in the United
    Domestic Workers, the 1980&#8217;s anti-intervention and solidarity movement,
    and in the apartheid divestment campaigns form my basic organizing skills
    and frameworks. As a doctor and movement agitator, I bring a unique perspective
    to some of our key values like non-violence, and working alongside and complementary
    to, the broader movements for social change, peace and justice.<br>
    <br>
    3) My vision for being a member of the California delegation to the GPUS
    is to help facilitate a broader more tolerant of diverse opinions policy,
    thus
    decreasing the threshold necessary to allow people to act and endorse in
    our name. Key to this is degree and there must be accountability. We must
    be able
    to more timely act and get our name our so that voters will see real leadership
    not some extreme form of the democratic party. I feel strongly that we must
    deadicate more resources to leadership development, professional student
    organizers, and that all our leadership development needs to emphasize and
    subsidize people
    of color and womyn. This can only be accomplished if we actively and collectively
    take up the issues important to these oppressed groups. Ultimately we will
    have to more effectively handle the tension between emergent caucuses in
    our orgs and the need to struggle for consensus and against &#8220;winning questions&#8221; and
    forcing them onto a minority. I generally favor setting up more representational
    distributions of delegate voters so that the results of our endorsement will
    unify rather than divide.<br>
