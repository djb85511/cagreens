  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  <br>
My name is Linda Piera-Avila. I am a 27 year resident of Santa Monica. I have
been registered Green since 1990.<br>
<br>
ACTIVISM:<br>
I participated in the planning of the 1996 Green Party convention, held at UCLA,
at which Ralph Nader was first nominated by the party to run on its ticket for<br>
president.<br>
<br>
I have at various times been an active member of different Green locals, including
the Los Angeles Greens and the Santa Monica Greens. I have previously served
as
secretary and as events coordinator for the Los Angeles Greens and am currently
most active with that local.<br>
<br>
Along with other Greens, I participated in the early days of the &quot;Arlington
West&quot; Iraq War memorial, held every Sunday on Santa Monica Beach. I have
participated in numerous peace marches and rallies. I coordinated the Los Angeles
Greens Earth Day event in 2005 at
which we hosted
Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler.<br>
<br>
I joined with other LA Greens to lobby LA City Council members to adopt STV voting
methods.<br>
<br>
I have volunteered on numerous Green campaigns, including Mike Feinstein's, Kevin
McKeown's, and Byron DeLear's campaigns.<br>
<br>
I have supported lobbying efforts in Sacramento to promote the Campaign for Old
Growth and tabled many, many hours to collect signatures on the petition for said
initiative.<br>
<br>
As a known Green I served on the Board of the West Bluffs Conservancy, which (unsuccessfully)
tried to save an adjoining bluff ecosystem, part of the larger Ballona Wetlands
ecosystem.<br>
<br>
More recently I participated in the occupation of the South Central Farm, providing
a Green Party presence and liaison. I was quoted in a state press releaseregarding
this issue.<br>
<br>
Last September I was part of a 5 member Green Party contingent that joined a
larger 300 person civil disobedience action, all undergoing arrest and overnight
incarceration for the
sake of promoting a living wage for underpaid hotel workers in the LAX hotel corridor.<br>
<br>
PREVIOUS DELEGATE EXPERIENCE:<br>
I served as a delegate to a state plenary at least once, at the May 2005 General
Assembly in Sylmar Plenary.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          At this time I would like to assist the GPCA and serve as a national
              delegate to the GPUS.<br>
