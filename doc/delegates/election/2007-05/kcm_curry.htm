  3) Please describe your vision for
  serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing the job description for GPUS
  Delegate.<br>
  <br>
  My objective in joining the Green Party was and is about building a permanent
  third party here in the United States of America. For me, the way forward must
  be for our political party to emphasize direct action tactics and traditional
  electoral politics to women, people of color, independents and progressives
  in a clear and measurable manner. This given that the Democrats consistently
  take for granted all voters of color.<br>
  <br>
  After 5 years (2002-2007) of involvement at or with every level of the Green
  Party United State (local, state, national) I say we must combine our energy
  on all levels to create winning strategies that synergistically promote a Green
  vision appealing to the varied local, state and national interests of all voters.
  We must make securing the 5% mark of the national voter base the goal over
  the next 19 months (March 2007 -2008) this &#8220;doable&#8221; goal will not
  only ensure we will be eligible for federal matching funds for our 2008 slate.
  It (2008 national campaign) can benefit local organizing, bringing in new recruits,
  a new vitality and energy to the party. <br>
  <br>
  As a female of African descent , 45 years old (DOB 01/011962) I am a direct
  product of a nation which came thru the civil rights movement, the people who
  laid their bodies on the line in that movement are a significant part of my
  inspiration. <br>
  <br>
  As a historian, I have a &#8220;historical advantage&#8221; of looking at political
  and policies development over time. I&#8217;m fully aware that as a nation, &#8220;We
  are at an historic crossroads&#8221;. Our nation&#8217;s current political
  atmosphere and voter dissatisfaction has created a &quot;climate of opportunity&quot; for
  the Green Party on every level.</font></p>
