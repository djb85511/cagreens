  _____________________________________________________________<br>

  <font size="3">I have been a GP member for about 12 years. After voting Green
  in the last two presidential elections, I began getting more active. March
  2006 I was elected to my third term as a Green Party county council member.
  (You can read my bio for that election at <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2004/03/02/ca/sm/vote/everette_s/">www.smartvoter.org/2004/03/02/ca/sm/vote/everette_s/</a> ) </font> </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
            have attended at least nine state plenaries as a delegate or alternate.
            At plenaries, I have participated in GROW, Green Issues, International
            committee, and the state Women's Caucus. I attended my first national
            meeting in Washington, DC as an observer.&nbsp; I was a delegate
            to the Milwaukee national meeting and convention where I participated
            in the woman's caucus, attended some NC meetings and some meetings
            of the International committee as an observer. I supported Jo Chamberlain
            in her assembly race and Pat Gray for congress. I am a financial
            sustainer at the county, state, and national level.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially
            I became part of California's standing delegation running as an alternate
            because I saw it as a training position and because I did not think
            I had the time required to do the job well.&nbsp; Then I noticed
            that I still attend the meetings, the conferences calls, and read
            all the emails - occasionally even making comments.&nbsp; I realized
            that responsibilities would not be that different as a full delegate,
            and since there was a call for more women to run, I decided to go
            ahead and do that two years ago, and since that time attended national
            meetings in Tulsa and Tucson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a year later,
            I found myself pushed into the role as co-chair. Now my term is up
            and I am running for reelection.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
            the rest of my life, I am a teacher, a social and political activist,
            environmentalist, permaculture designer, and co-creator of the San
            Mateo Ecovillage.&nbsp; We are creating a compost tea business and
            promote the 10 key values on the side of our van.... I wrote an article
            about it for Green Focus. I love to travel and am fortunate that
            my husband works for United.&nbsp; I think of myself as a planetary
            citizen. Because of this interest, I joined the GPUS International
            committee.&nbsp; As I have been an activist since the 70's, I guess
            I have earned an additional diversity factor as a senior.&nbsp; I
            look forward to retiring in 2008 so that I can be a full-time activist<span
