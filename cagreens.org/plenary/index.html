<dt>
<strong>November 18, 2011</strong>
<dt>Transitioning to the new CAGreens site impacted our ability to post the packets. </dt>
<dd>Download <a href="http://cagreens.org/plenary/DraftAgendaDec_2011GA.pdf" target="_new">draft agenda pdf file</a> for including proposals. We expect a final update.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The information in the <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/ga/2011-12/agenda-draft" target="_blank">agenda packet </a>can also be found on line on our new site. The <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/ga/2011-12">logistics information</a> can all be found on the website and it was felt that there was no need to create and print a pdf for that.</p>
<p><a href="http://cagreens.nationbuilder.com/ga_dec2011_register" target="_blank">Registration</a> will be done in a new way and we expect that page to be online on November 19. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies for the delays, but this has been an exciting time of transition. It was complicated further because the agenda team member who had access to updating this page was in Europe and returned the night of November 17. While she was gone, it was believed that IT was the only one who could update this page and because they thought it was not being used any longer, did not assist in updating it. It was not planned originally by the web design team to use this page, but there was a request from one or more members of the CC to still use this page as it was felt that some people who naturally go to cagreens.org/plenary rather than finding where the information was available on the new site.</p>

<h3>CALL FOR FUTURE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOSTS / SITES</h3>

<p>The GPCA is putting out an <b>all-out call</b> for counties who are interested in hosting
a state meeting.  We need host counties for the following approximate dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spring 2012
<li>Summer/Fall 2012
</ul>
<p>
You provide the site, the food, and the volunteers; you handle the money; and we
provide the program. Whether you're an old or newly organized
county -- or even if you have yet to organize, and think that a state meeting
will help galvanize your county into action -- we are ready to meet in YOUR town!
<br>
We have a <A HREF="http://cagreens.org/grow/internal/PlenaryCookbook.pdf"><b>"Plenary Cookbook"
<img src="../pix/pdf.gif"></b></A> to guide you through planning process, and personal support from the Agenda Team.</p>
<P>
Preferences are to hold meetings in northern CA during the summer months and in southern
CA during the winter months (or anytime along the coast!).</p>
<P>
<i>(Note: Most meetings take at up to 6 months lead time to plan; more if a suitable site must be found.  The farther out you can commit to hosting, the better and easier it will be.)</i></p>
<P>
Contact the
<script>scramaddr_ex("cagreens.org","agenda-team","Agenda Team")</script> if <u>your</u> county is interested!</p>
