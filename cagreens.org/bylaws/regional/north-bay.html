<p>E-2. If more that one candidate is nominated for a seat, GPCA Bylaws Section 7-1.9 "Instant Runoff Voting" shall be applied to the seat's election.

<li>The ECC shall oversee the absentee voting process, as outlined in section J, below.</li>
</ol><p>F-3. Ballot Distribution. One ballot shall be used for each Regional Green Party Member voting - the ECC shall monitor the passing out of ballots to make sure that each voting member is an eligible voter (see section D above).</p>
<p>F-4. Ballot Collection. In-person ballots are received and then the verified voter list is checked to note that an eligible voter submitted a ballot, one per eligible member voting, and placed into a secured box.</p>
<p>F-5. Completion of Voting. The election box is not opened to count in-person ballots until the entire ECC is present.</p>
<p>F-6. Counting of Ballots. When the ballot box is opened, the number of ballots cast will first be counted to be certain the number of ballots matches the number of ballots cast as recorded on the registration list. If the number does not match, the in-person ballots are all voided and the election begins again.</p>
<p>F-7. Tabulation of results. If the number of in-person ballots is correct, then the in-person ballots are examined one by one and the results tabulated, according to the procedure in Section E above. The ECC shall be responsible for reviewing each ballot and tabulating votes.</p>

Information included on this document shall include but is not limited to: The election description, location, date, time, candidates running, votes tallied, signature line for each vote tabulator signature and date with a statement that they certify that the elections were fair, impartial, timely and in accordance with this Regional Representative alternative election procedure.</p>
<p>F-9. The number of ballots tabulated will be compared to the number of ballots cast, to be certain that all ballots are accounted for. If there is a discrepancy in the number of ballots tabulated with the ballots cast, the in-person election is voided and a new election is held immediately.</p>
<p>F-10. The ECC-certified votes from the absentee ballot tally (see separate procedure, section I, below) are added to the in-person votes.</p>
<p>F-11. If the entire ECC agrees that the elections were fair, impartial, timely and in accordance with this Regional Representative Alternative election procedure, the ECC shall announce the results</p>
<p>F-12. The Registered Green members attending the regional meeting then vote to certify the election. If the Region is unable to certify the election, a new election is immediately held.</p>
<h4>Section G: Post-Election Procedures</h4>
<p>G-1. Election Documents. The elections documents such as: election registration list, tally sheet, guest list, ballots are all secured and kept for a minimum of 12 months after the election.</p>
<p>G-2. Contested election results. If a Regional Green Party member who was present at the Regional Meeting objects or contests the elections the objection 1) must be submitted in writing to the ECC within one week after the election; 2) The ECC shall convene within 1 week to resolve the allegations or make a recommendation to the Regional Green Party Members to resolve the dispute. 3) If evidence exists that an infraction of the election rules has been verified then the ECC (fallback 2/3 vote) may call another regional meeting within four weeks to consider overturning the election. Overturning an election at a regional meeting requires a 3/5 fallback vote.</p>
<p>G-3. After seven days after the election, if no Regional Green Party Member who was present at the Regional Meeting contests the election, a representative of the ECC (on behalf of the entire ECC) must then inform the GPCA CC and the County Councils of the Region of the results of the election. This notification should occur within 21 days of the election, if it is uncontested.</p>
<p>G-4. As stated in Green Party of California Bylaws, until the election is reported by the ECC on behalf of the three County Councils, the previous Regional Representatives continue to serve in their prior capacities. If no report occurs prior to the GPCA General Assembly meeting, and the previous Regional Representatives have completed a two year term, then the newly elected regional representative will serve as interim regional representative until the election is reported to the GPCA.</p>
<h4>Section H: Term of office</h4>
<p>The elected Regional representative and alternate(s) shall serve a two year term commencing from the date of the regional meeting in which they were elected. They no longer serve if they are removed by the procedure noted in Article VIII below, resign, are permanently incapacitated or deceased, or are unable to be contacted by any of the County Councils for a period of 60 days. Ideally, a new regional meeting shall be held within 60 days of the end of the 2 year term of office.</p>
<h4>Section I: Second Alternate</h4>
<p>The GPCA has defined the roles and responsibilities of the second alternate delegate.</p>
<h4>Section J: Absentee Voting</h4>
<p>J-1: Regional Green Party Members unable to attend a Regional Meeting with an Election planned may submit an absentee vote, according to the procedure outlined here.</p>
<p>J-2: Any Regional Green Party Member requesting an absentee ballot must request one from the ECC no later than 7 days prior to the scheduled election.</p>
<p>J-3: The absentee ballot will be created by the ECC, and will include the names and personal statements (if available) of the candidates who have been nominated up to 7 days prior to the regional meeting, along with No Other Candidate (NOC) and a blank line for write-in candidates. All candidates from the Regional Election will also be included on the 1st alternate election ballot (along with NOC and a blank line), and all candidates for the Regional and Alternate election will be included on the 2nd alternate ballot (along with NOC and a blank line). The ballot is created and distributed in electronic format to those requesting an absentee ballot. With the absentee ballot will be a list of instructions written by the ECC. The ballot must be submitted in a sealed envelope (one ballot per envelope) with the following information on the outside of the sealed secret ballot envelope: Name of the person voting, county of membership, signature across the seal of the envelope, a copy of a photo ID (for name and signature verification, attached to the outside of the envelope), and phone number to contact the person, should verification be required. The absentee voter may optionally also attached proof of Green party voter registration. The ballots may be submitted by mail or in person to any of the ECC. For any absentee ballots collected in person by an ECC member, a single signed tally sheet will be used to collect their signatures to track the collected ballots, and each voter will be given a receipt. The sealed secret ballot envelope and copy of ID should be contained inside another envelope for mailing. Absentee ballots not in the hands of the ECC at the time of the election will not be counted.</p>
<p>J-4: The addition of new nominees after 7 days prior to the meeting does not affect this absentee voting procedure.</p>
<p>J-5: Sealed Absentee Ballots must be brought to the Regional meeting by a member of the ECC. Their Green party member status is verified under one of the methods described in Article VI, section D, and they are put on a list of Eligible Green party members who submitted absentee ballots.</p>
<p>J-6: If a Regional Green Party member submits an absentee ballot and is able to attend the meeting, the ECC must ask the member if they choose to vote in person or to use their absentee ballot. If they chose to vote in person, the absentee ballot will be destroyed by the ECC. The destroyed ballot will be preserved by the ECC in case of an election challenge.</p>
<p>J-7: During the voting process, the envelopes containing the absentee ballots are inspected by the ECC, to be sure the seal is intact, and the number of envelopes is recorded. As each envelope is opened, the ballots are numbered and the absentee ballots are maintained separately from the in-person ballots, in case a repeat vote of those present is required. Envelopes of ballots accepted in person by the ECC are compared to the tally sheets provided by the ECC under J-3. The number of ballots in each envelope is inspected by the ECC; any envelope with no ballot is recorded. Any envelope with more than one ballot is disqualified, and recorded.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX 1</h3>
<p>Consensus-Seeking Process</p>
<p>A proposal may be presented to the Regional Meeting for inclusion on the agenda of a Regional meeting, or it may grow naturally out of a meeting discussion. Either way, the proposal presenter provides a brief statement on the proposal, giving a written copy, if available, to the note taker. The facilitator determines if a quorum exists. If one does, the consensus-seeking process begins:</p>
<ol><li>The presenter answers "clarifying questions" from members.</li>
<li>The facilitator checks for affirmations and concerns.</li>
<li>Concerns are listed by a scribe where all can see them.</li>
<li>The facilitator gets a feel for the group's assessment of the proposal.</li>
<li>The group seeks to resolve those concerns deemed legitimate by incorporating them into the proposal. The presenter must agree to modifications before they can be made. The note taker reads back any modifications to be sure they are properly recorded.</li>
<li>The facilitator asks if there remain any unresolved concerns:<br /><ol type="a"><li>If there are no remaining concerns, the proposal is adopted with a plan for implementation.</li>
<li>If concerns remain, go to the next level for resolution.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The facilitator asks those holding concerns if they are willing to allow the group to adopt the proposal without their approval with their unresolved concerns being listed with the plan for implementation:<br /><ol type="a"><li>If those holding such concerns are agreeable, these "stand aside" concerns are recorded by the note taker and included in the minutes with the adopted proposal.</li>
<li>If someone holding a concern is unwilling to stand aside, go to the next level for resolution.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The facilitator addresses the remaining concerns one at a time as follows:<br /><ol type="a"><li>The concern is restated.</li>
<li>Questions clarify the concern.</li>
<li>Discussion focuses on the single concern.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The facilitator asks if all concerns are resolved:<br /><ol type="a"><li>If yes, the proposal is adopted.</li>
<li>If no, the facilitator asks for stand asides.</li>
<li>If a concern remains and the person is unwilling to stand aside, go to the closing options.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If time is being kept, the timekeeper will notify the facilitator when three minutes remain in the time allotted for the proposal. At this point, prior to submitting the proposal for vote, the facilitator will ask the presenter to decide on a closing option (should the proposal fail):<br /><ol type="a"><li>Send or return the proposal to a committee for further refinement and an attempt to resolve the legitimate concerns raised.</li>
<li>Suggest the empowerment of an ad hoc committee made up of the representatives of the remaining concerns and advocates of the proposal to reach some fair resolution:<br /><ol type="i"><li>to act on behalf of the membership if time is critical, or</li>
<li>to return to a subsequent meeting with a recommendation for adoption.</li>
<li>Request additional agenda time in the meeting to reach a resolution of any remaining concerns.</li>
<li>Request that the membership use the voting option.</li>
<li>Withdraw the proposal.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Request additional agenda time to complete the discussion. Requests for additional agenda time for an item will include a specific number of minutes and whether the time will be added to the length of the meeting or if it will come from some other item. A majority fallback vote of the membership is necessary to approve the request for more time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>When the closing option of voting is selected by the presenter of the proposal, the facilitator will proceed with the following steps:<br /><ol type="a"><li>The note taker will be asked to read the proposal as it stands.</li>
<li>The total "yes," "no" and "abstaining" votes of the active members shall be recorded and included in the meeting minutes.</li>
<li>A majority vote is necessary to approve a business item, unless an alternative fall-back approval is specified in this Alternative Election Procedure. Abstentions are not counted in calculating the percentage vote.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Points of Order: Any member may signal the facilitator by raising two hands if s/he:<br /><ol type="a"><li>Believes a violation of this procedure has taken place (POINT OF PROCESS)</li>
<li>Does not understand the procedure (POINT OF CLARIFICATION)</li>
<li>Has knowledge of an item of information that is important to the discussion (POINT OF INFORMATION).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h3>Appendix 2: Regional Green Party Members Norms of Behavior/Statement of Values</h3>
<ol><li>We will work together in a collaborative way and avoid words and actions that are divisive.</li>
<li>We will discuss ideas and information, not people. Refrain from ad hominem arguments.</li>
<li>We will be open to new ideas and information. When there is disagreement, we will attempt to understand the other's point of view and to bridge the gap, if possible, by seeking out more information.</li>
<li>We will allow people time to complete their thoughts and not interrupt.</li>
<li>We will encourage participation from of all of the Council.</li>
<li>In making decisions, our goal will be consensus where possible, or a clear statement of the area of disagreement, if consensus is not possible.</li>
<li>To encourage frank discussion and build a positive image of the Green Party, participants agree be cautious in sharing the details of the discussion (for example, who said what if it is not reflected in the agreed upon minutes; opinions on tone of voice and underlying motivations) to individuals outside the Green Party, and particularly to members of the media. Discussion of general ideas, concepts, election results and action items is encouraged.</li>
