<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.4(b) Facilitators shall be chosen who can facilitate the General Assembly according to the consensus-seeking process in 7-5, who can provide non-directive leadership and process clarity, and who honor the agenda and promote good will. A facilitator shall not give her/his personal opinion unless clearly stepping out of her/his role as a facilitator. Facilitators should be familiar with the Ten Key Values and the GPCA's Purpose, Bylaws, and Rules and Procedures. The use of gender-stacking, where the order of the "stack" would alternate between one woman, one man, shall be considered as a first choice for use by the facilitators.</strong></p>

<p><strong>7-5.5 Consensus Seeking Consensus shall be sought according to the following process:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(a) Delegates shall be given priority in decision-making discussions. At the discretion of the facilitation team and time permitting, other GPCA members and guests may participate. Only delegates may hold outstanding concerns.</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(c) Affirmations, concerns and proposed amendments follow from the delegates only. Presenters attempt to address concerns and may amend their proposal, in which case clarifying questions may again be made and responded to by the presenters. The proposal is then restated, including as amended, if amended by the presenters.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(d) The facilitator(s) should ask if there are any more unresolved, outstanding concerns. If there are none, the proposal is considered approved by consensus.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(e) If there remain outstanding concerns, the facilitators ask whether those holding outstanding concerns are willing to "stand aside" and have their concerns recorded in the minutes, along with the adopted proposal. If so, the proposal is considered approved by consensus, with the stand asides recorded.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(f) If there is not consensus, the presenter(s) may request more time from the General Assembly, go to a vote or withdraw the proposal. 7-5.5(g) If the presenter(s) go to a vote, the facilitators shall conduct a roll call and record each delegate's vote as "yes", "no" or "abstain". Passage shall be according to the approval thresholds in 7-2.3.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(h) If more time is added by the General Assembly, the presenters may attempt to address the remaining outstanding concerns, and may amend their proposal, in which case clarifying questions may be made and responded to. The proposal is then restated, including as amended, if amended. The process is then repeated to identify any outstanding concerns and whether those holding them are willing to stand aside. If there are no outstanding concerns, or if those holding them are willing to stand aside, the proposal is considered approved by consensus. If outstanding concerns remain, the presenters may go to a vote or withdraw their proposal.</strong></p>

<p><strong>7-5.6 Minutes The Coordinating Committee has the responsibility to ensure that minutes are taken at each General Assembly.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.7(b) Any delegate may signal the facilitator(s) by raising two hands on a Point of Information to provide a critical piece of information otherwise missing in the discussion. Delegates are expected to utilize this option sparingly and judiciously.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.7(c) Any delegate may signal the facilitator(s) by raising two hands on a Point of Process, if they believe the process being followed violates GPCA Bylaws, Rules and Procedures, Fiscal Policy or other such procedures adopted by the General Assembly.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
