<div><u><strong>Article 2. Purpose</strong></u></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Green Party of California is guided by its Platform and the "Ten Key Values" of the Green Movement: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Social Justice, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community Based Economics, Feminism, Respect for Diversity, Personal and Global Responsibility, and Sustainability.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> As the political expression of California's Green movement, we provide an electoral alternative competing directly with traditionally entrenched parties and others for elected office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> We engage in the electoral process in order to incorporate our values into the policies, laws and activities of local, state and national government, and into society as a whole. We affirm these electoral activities and act on this in coalition with other likeminded organizations as part of a larger social movement for world-wide peace, democracy, justice and environmental wisdom.<a name="Article 3.

<div> </div>
<div>b)    General Assembly committee presenter for a given proposal answers "clarifying questions" from delegates.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>c)     Facilitation team checks for affirmations and concerns.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     Concerns are listed by the scribe where all can see them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     Facilitation team gets a feel for everyone's assessment of the proposal.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>d)    The group seeks to resolve those concerns deemed legitimate by incorporating them into the proposal - presenter must agree to modifications before they can be made. Note takers read back any modifications to be sure they are properly recorded.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>e)     The facilitation team asks if there remain any unresolved concerns.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     If there are no remaining concerns, the proposal is adopted with the plan for implementation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     If concerns remain, go to the next level for resolution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>f)     The facilitation team asks those holding concerns if they are willing to allow the group to adopt the proposal without their approval, having their unresolved concerns listed with the plan for implementation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     If those holding such concerns are agreeable, these "stand aside" concerns are recorded with the note takers and included in the minutes with the adopted proposal.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     If the person holding a concern is unwilling to stand aside, the facilitation team moves to the next level to seek a resolution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>g)    The facilitation team addresses the remaining concerns one at a time as follows:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     The concern is restated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     Questions clarify the concern.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.     Discussion focuses on the single concern.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>h)    The facilitation team asks if all concerns are resolved.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     If yes, the proposal is adopted; stand asides are recorded with the implementation plan.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     If no, facilitation team asks for stand asides.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.     If concern remains and is unwilling to stand aside, go to the closing options.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>i)      Closing options are the prerogative of the presenter and the advocating committee. They include:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     Return the proposal to committee for further refinement and an attempt to resolve the legitimate concerns raised.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     Suggest the empowerment of an ad hoc group made up of representatives of the remaining concerns and advocates of the proposal to reach some fair resolution and:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>        i) to act on behalf of the Green Party if time is critical in the matter or</div>
<div> </div>
<div>        ii) to return to a subsequent plenary with a recommendation for adoption.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.     Request additional time in the plenary to reach a resolution of any remaining concerns.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4.     Request that the General Assembly use the voting option.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>j)      Requests for additional agenda time for an item shall include a specific number of minutes and whether the time will be added to the length of the meeting or if it will come from some other item. An 80% vote of the delegates is necessary to approve the request for more time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>k)     Voting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>        When the closing option of voting is selected by the presenter of the proposal, the facilitation team shall proceed in the following steps:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     The note taker shall be asked to read the proposal as it stands.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     The scribe shall record the vote of the delegates where all can see it by "yes", "no" and "abstain".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.     The facilitation team shall call a roll and record each delegate vote with the help of the doorkeeper.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4.     2/3 vote is necessary to approve a "business" item.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5.     80% vote is necessary to approve a "policy" item.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6.     If uncertain, the 80% figure is necessary.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>7.     Abstentions are not counted in calculating the percentage vote. The minimum number of affirmative votes required to pass a proposal shall be the voting threshold times the decision making quorum.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>8.     The roll call recorded vote shall be included in the meeting minutes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>l)      When time runs out....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>        The time keeper shall notify the facilitation team when three minutes remain in the time allotted for a proposal. At this point, the presenter shall decide on a closing option.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5-8.10      Points of order</div>
<div> </div>
<div>a)     Any delegate may signal the facilitation team (by raising two hands) on a POINT OF CLARIFICATION if they do not understand the procedure or they believe a violation of these procedures has taken place. In doing so, they must identify at the outset which item in these procedures is at issue.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     The facilitation team shall rule on the point of clarification.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>b)    Any delegate may signal the facilitation team on a POINT OF PROCEDURE if they have a procedural suggestion that they feel will aid or improve the facilitation of the discussion. Signal with two hands.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>c)     A POINT OF INFORMATION may be asked for at any time:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.     By the facilitation team when there is an item of information that is important to the discussion;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>        or</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.     By a note taker when there is some item of information that is important to record.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5-8.11      Consent Calendar</div>
<div> </div>
<div>a)     The Coordinating Committee may place on the agenda a consent calendar, of proposals judged to be non-controversial. These proposals may be approved without presentations, clarifying questions, or debate.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>b)    Any proposals so presented must have been made available in written form to the county organizations and the delegates prior to the meeting (but in no case later than the agenda packet); and any proposal that receives any objection at the time it is presented shall be removed from the consent calendar before approval.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>c)     The Coordinating Committee shall assign each proposal on the consent calendar to a committee on a contingency basis. Any proposal removed from the consent calendar by objection shall be assigned to its contingent committee for consideration.</div>

<div><u><strong><a name="Article 12. Rules and Procedures" id="Article 12. Rules and Procedures"></a>Article 12. Rules and Procedures</strong></u></div>
<p>Section 12-1. Status of Rules and Procedures</p>
<p>Rules and procedures shall have the force of bylaws, except that where a rule or procedure conflicts with these bylaws, the bylaws shall take precedence. Rules and procedures may be overridden by a 2/3 vote of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Section 12-2. Adoption of Rules and Procedures</p>
<p>12-2.1      Initiation of rules and procedures</p>
<p>Rules and procedures shall be initiated by the Coordinating Committee or by any other Standing Committee or Working Group of the General Assembly ("initiating body"). A proposed rule or procedure shall be submitted by the initiating body to the Bylaws Committee and Coordinating committee for review and possible amendment using the process described in this Article.</p>
<p>12-2.2      Review and approval of rules and procedures</p>
<p>a)     The Bylaws Committee shall review the proposed rule or procedure for clarity and internal consistency, to minimize ambiguity, and for consistency with these bylaws and with existing rules and procedures.</p>
<p>b)    The Coordinating Committee shall solicit feedback from each county organization through the regional representatives and county councils, and from affected Standing Committees and Working Groups through their co-coordinators.</p>
<p>c)     The initiating body shall review any proposed changes for consistency with the intent of the proposed rule or procedure.</p>
<p>The review process shall continue until the Bylaws Committee, the Coordinating Committee, and the initiating body have each approved the final version by a 2/3 vote, or until the proposal is withdrawn by the initiating body, or is rejected by a 2/3 vote of the Coordinating Committee. If the proposed rule or procedure is approved. it shall be ratified by the General Assembly before taking effect.</p>
<p>12-2.3      General Assembly clarifications and concerns</p>
<p>Once approved, new rule or procedure shall be placed on the agenda of the next General Assembly such that agenda notification requirements can be satisfied. A limited amount of agenda time, but no less than 15 minutes, shall be allocated for each new rule or procedure. The agenda time shall be used to request clarification and to express concerns or affirmations. No amendments, excepting those for the correction of errors, shall be in order.</p>
<p>12-2.4      Ratification of rules and procedures</p>
<p>At the end of the time period, the General Assembly shall be polled for outstanding concerns. If 1/5 or more of the delegates present, as determined by the most recent quorum count, request that the rule or procedure be taken up by the General Assembly, the rule or procedure shall be placed on the agenda of the current (time permitting) or next General Assembly, where it shall be treated as a business item, subject to a 2/3 vote; alternatively, the initiator may choose to withdraw the rule or procedure. If the rule or procedure is not withdrawn, and polling of the General Assembly results in fewer than 1/5 of the delegates with outstanding concerns, the rule or procedure is ratified, and shall remain in effect until amended or revoked by this process.</p>
<p>In summary, the rule or procedure may:</p>
<p>a) be withdrawn by its initiator,</p>
<p>b) be suspended pending full consideration by the General Assembly,</p>
<p>c) take effect until amended or revoked.</p>
<p>Section 12-3. Amendment or revocation of rules and procedures</p>
<p>Rules and procedures shall be amended or revoked through the same process as approval of new rules and procedures.</p>
<p><u><strong><a name="Appendix A: Method of Equal Proportions" id="Appendix A: Method of Equal Proportions"></a>Appendix A: Method of Equal Proportions</strong></u></p>
<div> (referenced in bylaws, paragraph 4-2.2, delegate allocation formula)</div>
<div>
<p>Definition of Method of Equal Proportions</p>
<p>The Method of Equal Proportions is a method adopted by the U.S. Congress to fairly allocate the House of Representatives seats among the states which is easily adapted to fairly allocate GPCA General Assembly delegate seats among the active counties.</p>
<p>To fairly allocate the 100 delegate seats, we must first decide on a good measure of "unfairness" and adopt an allocation method which minimizes this measure.</p>
<p>The Method of Equal Proportions is based on minimizing the "relative difference" between the "representation" of any two counties, where "representation" is the number you get by dividing the county's registered Greens by the number of seats allocated to the county. The seats are allocated such that transferring a seat from any county with more than one seat to any other county does not reduce the ratio of the higher representation to the lower representation.</p>
<p>There are two different ways to perform this method. Both are equivalent and will yield the same results. We'll call one the "ranking method" and the other the "rounding method". Computer software is available to assist with the actual calculations (see the bylaws committee coordinators).</p>
<p>The Ranking Method:</p>
<p>In this method, a series of "priority values" are calculated for each county. First each county is allocated one seat then the priority values are ranked in order and the remaining seats allocated one by one to the counties from the highest priority value to the lowest until all seats are allocated.</p>
<p>To calculate the priority values, first a series of "multipliers" are obtained by calculating the reciprocal of the geometric mean for the integers 2 through 20.</p>
<p>1 / [square root of n(n-1)]</p>
<p>where n is an integer from 2 to 20</p>
<p>The priority values are obtained by multiplying the number of registered Greens in each county by these "multipliers." Each county should have now have a series of priority values which determines the order in which seats are allocated.</p>
<p>The Rounding Method:</p>
<p>In this method, each county's allocation is determined by dividing the number of registered Greens in each county by a special "divisor" and rounding any fractions by using the geometric mean (rather than the usual arithmetic mean or average).</p>
<p>The geometric mean is calculated by obtaining the square root of the product of the two whole numbers on either side of the fractional number obtained above. If the fractional number is less than the geometric mean, round down to the nearest whole number. Otherwise, round up.</p>
<p>The divisor will be equal to or near the number obtained by dividing the total number of registered Greens (in active counties) by 100 (the total number of seats). This divisor is adjusted until the total number of seats allocated using this rounding method is exactly equal to 100.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>[referenced in bylaws, paragraph 8-2.1 f), Duties and Authority of the Campaigns &amp; Candidates Working Group]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Exerpt from the original proposal of April 2008:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. Membership.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Campaign Financial Support Committee (CFSC) shall consist of two GPCA members from each of the GPCA Coordinating Committee (CC), Finance Committee and Campaigns and Candidates Working Group (CCWG). Each SC/WG shall use its own ordinary processes for making such appointments. A current SC/WG/GPUS Delegates Coordinator shall not be eligible to be a CFSC member. Any person who is, or who has announced an intention to be, a candidate for elected office, or anyone serving as a campaign manager, treasurer or consultant for such a candidate, is ineligible to be a CFSC member. Quorum for the CFSC shall be at least three CFSC members.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. Term of Office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CFSC members shall be appointed not later than the General Assembly at which the GPCA annual budget is submitted for adoption, and shall serve a one year term. CFSC members may not serve more than three consecutive terms. In the event a vacancy occurs in any CFSC position, the SC/WG that appointed the person who has resigned or become disqualified shall appoint the replacement to serve the remainder of the applicable term of appointment as soon as practicable after the vacancy occurs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3. Responsibilities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CFSC shall have the responsibility to decide what campaign committees shall receive funds from the part of the annual GPCA budget approved for the financial support of GPCA candidates for elected office. The CFSC shall establish procedures for candidates to apply for funding, including an application form or questionnaire and application deadlines, that shall be generally communicated via GPCA email lists and publications and posted on the CCWG webpage(s). Drafts of those procedures and forms also shall be published to the CC, CCWG and County Contacts email lists for at least 15 days to allow comments before adoption.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Procedures adopted by the CFSC shall continue until modified. The CFSC shall internally establish general principles for prioritizing the distribution of limited funds in each GPCA fiscal year. Within 60 days following any election in which the CFSC designates funding for candidates, the CFSC shall provide a written report of its funding deliberations and decisions to the CC and CCWG (Co)Coordinators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4. Authority.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CFSC funding decisions shall be communicated directly to the GPCA Treasurer for transmittal of funds as decided by the CFSC. Any funding decision shall require agreement by a minimum of three CFSC members. The GPCA Treasurer shall promptly issue funds as designated by the CFSC except where either (a) the donation would result in the candidate's committee receiving more cumulative donations than allowed by statute or regulation or (b) where the candidate declines all or part of the donation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The GPCA Treasurer shall promptly report either such circumstance to the CFSC which may amend its previous determinations upon receipt of such information. The CFSC may request the assistance of the CCWG or any other GPCA committee, working group or county organization in its processes for evaluating candidates' applications for GPCA financial support.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5. Funding Eligibility.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, to be eligible for GPCA campaign donations:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A. Candidates for non-partisan municipal, county and special district races, California state legislature and U.S. House of Representative must obtain the endorsement of any active Green Party county organization operating within the boundaries of the district for the applicable office. Endorsements must be communicated directly to the CFSC by a County Council member of the County GP or a designated officer of an applicable GP County Local.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>B. Candidates for partisan statewide constitutional offices (Governor, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer and State Comptroller); Non-Partisan statewide constitutional offices (Superintendent of Education); State Board of Equalization and U.S. Senate must obtain GPCA endorsement by a General Assembly of Delegates or County Polling. [The text of this subsection shall automatically be amended in the event the California Secretary of State is amended to become a nonpartisan office.]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>C. In special circumstances (e.g., large voting districts with multiple county organizations; special elections), the CFSC may waive the endorsement requirement on a case-by-case basis. However, in such cases, a candidate will need to demonstrate local support by endorsement of at least one active County GP, or endorsement by one or more Locals, or endorsement by the CCWG, or some other form of internal GPCA organizational endorsement, as a funding eligibility requirement.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>D. Candidates for partisan office shall not receive GPCA financial support unless they are the GPCA nominee following the GPCA Primary Election.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>E. Committees related to issue campaigns are not eligible for funding under these procedures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><u><strong><a name="Appendix_C:_County_Polling_Procedure" id="Appendix_C:_County_Polling_Procedure"></a>Appendix C: County Polling Procedure</strong></u></div>
<div> </div>
<div>[referenced in bylaws, paragraph 8-2.1 g), Duties and Authority of the Campaigns &amp; Candidates Working Group]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Exerpt from the original proposal of April 2008:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A County Polling Committee (CPC) is hereby established as part of the programs and activities responsibilities of the Campaigns and Candidates Working Group (CCWG).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. Co-Coordinators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CPC will be led by two Co-Coordinators appointed by the CCWG (Co)Cordinator(s) not later than the end of the first state meeting held in odd numbered years. The GPCA Coordinating Committee (CC) Liaison to the CCWG shall promptly inform the CC Co-Coordinators of the names and contact information for those persons.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Except as otherwise provided below, the term of office for CPC Coordinators shall be two years from date of appointment. In the event of a vacancy, the CCWG (Co)Coordinator(s) shall appoint a replacement to complete the term of office. In the event the term of office of a CPC Co-Coordinator expires and there has not been a re-appointment or replacement appointed, the term of office of the current Co-Coordinators shall continue until new appointments are made or until the current Co-Coordinators resign or become disqualified (i.e., by change of residence or party affiliation).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Transition Provisions: The initial terms of office shall start upon adoption of this proposal and shall continue until 2009. Upon adoption, the CCWG (Co)Coordinator(s) shall promptly appoint the initial CPC Co-Coordinators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. Responsibilities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CPC shall coordinate the collection of reports describing and making recommendations concerning statewide ballot measures prior to formal polling of active GPCA county organizations (Count GPs). The CPC shall publish its report(s) as part of a County Polling process to determine if sufficient County GPs support or oppose specific ballot measures to constitute a GPCA position opposing or supporting that measure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CPC reports on ballot measures shall include an analysis of each proposition in relation to the GPCA Platform, resolutions and general principles. Each report shall conclude with a recommendation and the name(s) and county of each author of the report. Each County Polling report may include multiple reports on different initiatives or referendum and shall include instructions on how County GPs are to respond to the request for County Polling responses, including the time period for any County Polling on ballot measures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CPC will collect responses from County GPs and report those results to the CC, the CCWG and the County GPs. The CPC Co-Coordinators shall serve as the administrators and lead contacts for the CPC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3. Processes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Promptly after the close of the ballot certification date and announcement by the California Secretary of State of measures certified for inclusion in the next statewide ballot, the CPC shall invite any GPCA member to participate in summarizing and evaluating ballot measures. To the extent possible, this invitation will precede the close of the certification period. The CPC Co-Coordinators shall promptly form teams from volunteers to complete the applicable reports within approximately one month following the close of the certification date.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The reports shall be communicated to County GPs via the County Contacts email list and by other additional methods as the CPC Co-Coordinators may consider appropriate. County GPs will report their respective positions on each ballot measure. A County GP may choose among the following choices for each ballot measure: "Yes" or "Support" (meaning the County GP votes that the GPCA should support the measure); "No" or "Oppose" (meaning the County GP votes that the GPCA should oppose the measure); "No Position" (meaning that the County GP votes that the GPCA should not take any position on the measure); or "Abstain" (meaning that County GP takes no position on what should be the GPCA position). Abstentions will be counted to determine quorum, but will not be counted to determine if there are sufficient votes to support, or oppose, or have no GPCA position, on a ballot measure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>County GPs shall have the same number of votes on each ballot measure as the County GP could have a total number of delegates at the first General Assembly of Delegates to be held following the start of the County Polling period. A County GP may report a distribution of votes for any ballot measure as decided by its internal processes up to the maximum number of its total delegate votes. County Polling results shall be communicated by at least one County Council member of the County GP to the CPC Co-Coordinators in writing (including email). A County GP may divide its votes as to any ballot measure by half votes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A quorum for purposes of County Polling shall be at least one half (1/2) of the total number of active GPCA county organizations at the time of the start of the County Polling period. If quorum is not achieved from the number of reports received by the CPC Co-Coordinators for any ballot measure by the completion of the County Polling period (including extensions), no GPCA position will result from the County Polling as to that measure. A GPCA position to support, or oppose, or have no GPCA position on a ballot measure shall require a minimum of Eighty Percent (80%) of the number of votes received by the close of County Polling Period. If that threshold of votes is not received by the CPC Co-Coordinators for any ballot measure by the completion of the County Polling period (including extensions), no GPCA position will result from the County Polling as to that measure (notwithstanding achievement of quorum). If that threshold of votes is received by the CPC Co-Coordinators for any ballot measure by the completion of the County Polling period (including extensions), then that position to support, or oppose, or have no GPCA position on the ballot measure shall be the formal position of the GPCA, effective immediately.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>County Polling will begin approximately one month following the close of the ballot certification date and last for a period of approximately five weeks. Promptly following the close of the Polling period, the CPC Co-Coordinators shall report the results to the CC Co-Coordinators, CCWG (Co)Coordinator(s),Media Committee (Co)Coordinator(s) and to the County Contacts email list.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the event a quorum has not been achieved during the initial polling period, the CPC Co-Coordinators may extend the polling period for as long as an additional three weeks, or until two days before the convening of the next General Assembly of Delegates, whichever occurs first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For purposes of example, the schedule for County Polling in 2008 is expected to be as follows:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>End of January 2008 Certification date for ballot measures on June 2008 ballot</div>
<div> </div>
<div>February 2008 Collect ballot measure reports</div>
<div> </div>
<div>March 2008 County Polling</div>
<div> </div>
<div>April 2008 Announce County Polling results</div>
<div> </div>
<div>End of June 2008 Certification date for ballot measures on November 2008 ballot</div>
<div> </div>
<div>July 2008 Collect ballot measure reports</div>
<div> </div>
<div>August 2008 County Polling</div>
<div> </div>
<div>September 2008 Announce County Polling results</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4. Plenary Agenda.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Agenda Team shall schedule and the CPC Co-Coordinators shall report on County Polling results at the beginning of the first day of the first GPCA Assembly of Delegates (Plenary) following the close of any County Polling period, or if the Plenary begins during the County Polling period.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the event the GPCA position as to any ballot measure has not been determined by County Polling not later than two days before the commencement of the General Assembly of Delegates immediately following the start of the County Polling period, consideration of each such ballot measure shall be presented to the Delegates for determining the GPCA position, if any, as part of the Plenary Agenda. The CPC Co-Coordinators shall promptly advise the Plenary Agenda Team concerning any such items to be presented at that Plenary.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The CPC ballot measures reports and voting instructions to County GPs shall be published in the Agenda Packet for that Plenary. The CCWG and CPC Co-Coordinators shall have joint responsibility to present those issues for support, opposition or taking no position by the General Assembly of Delegates whose decision shall establish the GPCA position as to any ballot measure position not decided by County Polling.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The provisions of this Section 4. shall apply only if the Plenary is held not less than four weeks before the election in which any applicable measure appears on the ballot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5. Ballot Measures Polling, Only.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The procedures described above apply only regarding determining GPCA positions as to statewide ballot measures. Similar procedures may be adopted concerning candidate endorsements or other GPCA decision-making, but use of any County Polling process for those, or any other purposes, is not part of this proposal. If this proposal is adopted, it shall apply only to procedures regarding determining GPCA positions on statewide ballot measures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6. Regional Representatives.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regional Representatives have the responsibility to actively encourage County GP's in their geographic area of responsibility to respond to County Polling and return timely reports of votes on each ballot measure. Following County Polling, Regional Representatives shall submit a written report to the CC concerning the status of any County GP that has not filed a timely County Polling report.</div>
