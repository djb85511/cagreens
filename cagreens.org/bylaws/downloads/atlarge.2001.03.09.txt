SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE ELECTION HELD AT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT WHICH THIS
LANGUAGE IS ADOPTED. The Coordinating Committee shall appoint three election
officials to conduct the election in a manner consistent with the following
specifications.

a)  Approval Voting When Only One Nominee Seeks Office.
When one nominee seeks office, each delegate will be provided a written
secret ballot containing the name of the nominee seeking office. The ballot
will allow the opportunity to indicate a "yes" or "no" preference on the
seating of the nominee. The nominee must receive "yes" votes on at least
two-thirds (2/3) of ballots cast to be seated.

b)  Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) When Only One Seat is Vacant and Two or More
Nominees Seek Office.
When only one seat is vacant and two or more nominees seek office each
delegate will be provided a written secret ballot containing the names of
the nominees seeking office. The names will appear in random order. The
ballot shall also include a "No other candidate" (NOC) option. The delegates
will rank the nominees along with the NOC options in order of preference.
The ballots will be tabulated utilizing instant runoff voting. No nominee
will be seated who does not cross the threshold before NOC.

c)  Choice Voting When Two or more At-large seats are Vacant and Two or More
Nominees Seek Office.
When two or more at-large seats are vacant and two or more nominees seek
office, each delegate will be provided a written secret ballot containing
the names of the nominees seeking office. The names will appear in random
order. The ballot shall also include a "No other candidate" (NOC) option.
The delegates will rank the nominees along with the NOC option in order of
preference. The ballots will be tabulated utilizing a "choice" voting system
with fractional transfers and the use of a Droop threshold based on the
number of vacant at-large seats. Choice Voting is the Single Transferable
Vote (STV) form of proportional representation described in the
International IDEA Handbook of Electoral System Design. (Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). First published 1997. Second
edition. Stockholm, Sweden). The Droop threshold is the percentage of votes
equal to [1] ONE divided by the number of vacant at-large seats plus one
seat
{1/(n+1)}. No nominee will be seated who does not cross the threshold before
NOC.

THERE MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THE DELEGATE PACKET DISTRIBUTED TO ALL COUNTY
PARTIES, AND THERE MUST BE PRESENTED TO ALL DELEGATES PRESENT AT THE GENERAL
ASSEMBLY WHERE AN ELECTION IS TO BE HELD, A FULL AND DETAILED EXPLAINATION
OF THE VOTING PROCEDURE AS IS LISTED ABOVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE NO OTHER
CHOICE OPTION, THE FACT THAT DELEGATES SHOULD MAKE THEIR CHOICES SERIOUSLY,
AND THE FACT THAT DELEGATES DO NOT HAVE TO FILL ALL SEATS UNLESS THEY FEEL
THERE ARE
ENOUGH QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO FILL THE VACANT POSITIONS SHOULD BE
EMPHASISED.

SHOULD A VACANCY OCCUR FOR ANY AT-LARGE COORDINATING COMMITTEE SEAT BECAUSE
OF FAILURE TO ELECT, RESIGNATION, REMOVAL, DEATH, OR ABANDONMENT OF THE
POSITION, AN ELECTION TO FILL THE VACANT SEAT OR SEATS SHALL BE HELD AT THE
NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS IN 7.1.6 A-C. THIS
ELECTION SHALL ONLY BE HELD IF ALL PREVIOUS NOTICE AND APPLICATION
PROCEDURES AS LISTED IN SECTION 7-1.6 TAKE PLACE . HOWEVER, ANY AT-LARGE
COORDINATING COMMITTEE MEMBER ELECTED AT A GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING OTHER
THAN THOSE SPECIFIED IN SECTION 7-1.6 SHALL HAVE THEIR TERM EXPIRE AS IF
THEY WERE ELECTED AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 7-1.6.
