Bylaws Proposal: Structure and Filing of Bylaws

A bylaw amendment proposal from the Bylaws Committee for consideration at the April 2001 Plenary. This amendment would replace the current Article 3 and Paragraph 7-1.4

_________________________________

Article 3. Structure

Section 3-1. State Organization

3-1.1	General Assembly
The General Assembly is the primary decision-making body of the GPCA, consisting of delegates from each active county organization recognized by the GPCA.

Section 3-2. County Organizations

3-2.1	Definition and Delegation of Authority
Green Party county organizations recognized by the General Assembly are the official organizations of the GPCA at the county level.

3-2.2	County Organization and Recognition
To be recognized by the General Assembly and to seat General Assembly delegates, a county organization must adopt organizational bylaws consistent with the 10 key values, the GPCA bylaws, and California law, and must file a current copy of these bylaws with the GPCA Bylaws Committee (see also Paragraph 4-1.22 for recognition of a new county organization). These bylaws must:

a)	Describe the organizational structure including the relationship between any local Green organizations and the County Council;
b)	Define the membership of the organization;
c)	Describe the decision-making process;
d)	Describe the process for filling county council vacancies;
e)	Describe the process for selecting General Assembly delegates;
f)	Establish the office of treasurer.

7-1.4	Selection of Regional Members
Regional members shall be selected by regional caucus of delegates at General Assembly meetings, unless the active counties of a region select another process. Any such alternative process must be consistent with the 10 key values, GPCA bylaws, and California law; and approved by all the County Councils of the active counties of a region; and filed with the Coordinating Committee and the Bylaws Committee. Regions with two seats are encouraged to fill at least one seat with a woman for gender balance.
