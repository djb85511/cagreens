  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  </font><br>
          I would like to run for a Delegate seat on the Green National Committee.
            I am currently the Chair of the Humboldt County Green Party (GPHC)
            County Council, serving in that capacity since winning a position
            on the County Council in the June 2006 general election. At that
            time, there was serious contention within the Humboldt Greens. In
            the nine months since then, we have revised our bylaws, created a
            harmonious, productive organization, and have won the respect and
            support of the press and our allies in the peace, justice, and environmental
            community.<br>
            <br>
          I am also serving on a number of GPHC committees: Communications (press
          releases, member linkage, and web site management); Fundraising; GROW
          (Tabling and Outreach); Planning Committee for the General Assemblies;
          Bylaws Committee; and the newly formed Planning Committee for the Strategic
          Planning Retreat (which we hope to hold late this summer). I attended
          the GPCA Strategic Retreat in February. I am currently learning web
          site design and will begin constructing a new web site for Humboldt
          Greens in April. I also serve as Secretary for the Northern Humboldt
          Greens local. <br>
          <br>
          I work full time as a special education teacher (Resource Specialist
          Program) for Mattole Valley Charter School, serving home school families
          and small alternative school sites in northern Humboldt. I am also
          involved in the Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom
          (WILPF), Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County (DUHC), and the Co-op
          Affairs Committee of the Northcoast Co-op. I have led four study groups
          on Challenging Corporate Power and was on the Steering Committee for
          Measure T, the Humboldt County initiative to ban participation of non-local
          corporations in Humboldt County elections.<br>
          My participation in these campaigns involved hours of petition gathering,
          phone banking, and letter writing to the editors of local newspapers
          in addition to organizational responsibilities. I received training
          in consensus process from the WILPF National. I have participated in
          strategic planning for Measure T and Democracy Unlimited. I enjoy networking
          and working collaboratively with others. All of my experience has required
          active listening, conflict resolution skills, and creative problem
          solving. <br>
          <br>
          My ultimate goal is to build the Green Party into a respected organization
          that can be trusted to implement the hopes and aspirations of the people
          we represent. In order to achieve that goal, I believe we must first
          build unity and consensus within the Party. How to help achieve these
          goals will necessarily evolve as I learn about the issues and processes
          involved. If chosen as a delegate, I will reserve judgment and decisions
          until I have garnered a full understanding of the issues and their
          potential impacts. I am able to attend both the May State Plenary in
          San Francisco and the National Convention in Pennsylvania. I can also
          participate in conference calls and email communications as much as
          time allows.<br>
