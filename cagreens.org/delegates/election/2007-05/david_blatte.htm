  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  <br>
  My active involvement in the Green Party is relatively recent, beginning when
  I moved to Humboldt County from the Bay Area at the end of 2006 and became
  a member of the Humboldt Greens County Council. However, I have been an activist
  my entire adult life and have always embraced the Key Values of the Green Party.
  I have been a registered Green for eight years.<br>
  <br>
I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1990 and spent
four years as a public defender in Philadelphia, representing criminal defendants
who could not afford to hire a private attorney. After that I moved to California
and taught math at Berkeley High School. Following that I became executive director
of Vegan Action, a nonprofit that promotes veganism. After that I started and
maintained a private law practice in the new and developing field of Animal Law,
providing representation whenever animals were in need of legal assistance. I
am currently in the beginning stages of writing a book that details progressive
approaches to current political issues, using the Green Party platform as a starting
point.<br>
<br>
The skills acquired as a lawyer are particularly pertinent to my continued involvement
in the Party and as a delegate. In general, I am very interested in process and
organization, and in particular I hope to join the GPUS committee on Bylaws,
Rules, Policies and Procedures. I also anticipate joining several committees
in the GPCA, focusing where my legal and organizational skills best apply. <br>
<br>
As a delegate, I will at a minimum attend all required meetings. On top of that,
I hope to help shape the growth of the Party, both nationally and on the state
level, through active involvement. This is a pivotal and dynamic time, and through
our collaborative effort the Green Party can become an effective and influential
voice in shaping the political debate.</font></p>
