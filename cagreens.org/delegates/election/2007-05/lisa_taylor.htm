  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  <br>
  I Joined the Green Party in 2000 and catapulted into seemingly non-stop outreach
  and activism! Myself and a colleague have been dubbed the &quot;tabling queens&quot; of
  our local. The last 5 years I have served on the elected steering committee
  of my local, the Los Angeles (City) Greens, as the Volunteer Coordinator.<br>
  <br>
  I'm a member of GROW and participate consistently online in the Campaigns/Candidates
  and Media Working Groups and have been a delegate at several state plenaries
  and gatherings.<br>
  <br>
  Lead organizer of the 2004 Los Angeles Greens Women's History Month event:
  Petra Kelly's Legacy, with guest speaker Clare Greensfelder. Assisted in organizing
  the Los Angeles Greens Earth Day 2005 event with guest speaker Rex Weyler,
  cofounder of Greenpeace International; and the Los Angeles Greens Earth Day
  2006 Biofuels event. <br>
  <br>
  Volunteer on campaigns: City Council Campaigns of Denise Munro Robb and Derek
  Milosavljevic, Sara Amir, Peter Camejo, Peter Thottam for Assembly. On Staff
  of Byron De Lear for Congress, 2006. <br>
  <br>
  I bring a decade of experience in the non-profit sector, as Membership Coordinator
  and Training Director of a large community organization, the Los Angeles Macintosh
  Group. <br>
  <br>
  Provided database support on union campaigns: Organization of Los Angeles Workers,
  American Federation of Teachers College Guild, and L.A. County Federation of
  Labor. City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Registrar intermittent employee
  administering Early Touchscreen Voting. (Yes, it is good to have a Green in
  there as an employee and watching!)<br>
  <br>
  I would like to assist California in making good decisions at the national
  level and ask for your support.</font></p>
