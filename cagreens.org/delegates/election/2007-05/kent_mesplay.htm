  _____________________________________________________________<br>

  With your vote of support and encouragement I will continue serving the Green
  Party at the national level as a representative of California, a state rich
  in diversity and other resources. I have been registered with the Green Party
  since 1995. I run for high level public office (Presidency 2004, 2008; U.S.
  Senate 2006 (and I was pleased to earn 1/6 of the votes)) as a means of educating
  the public on green principles and drawing attention to local candidacies.
  Currently, I am helping coordinate college interns as a member of the Green
  Party San Diego County Council.<br>
  <br>
  When re-elected as a delegate to the Green National Committee I anticipate
  providing further balance, calm and insight to our delegation while performing
  regular minimal duties of teleconference and state-wide meeting attendance
  and studying and voting on proposals put forth nationwide by other delegates.
  At the national meeting in Tuscon I co-authored and helped present from the
  floor a proposal to bring acceptable process to a grievance by one of the two
  state green parties in Utah. As a former rain-forest dweller, a descendant
  of the Blackfeet, a Ph.D. in the sciences and having an avocation in art and
  music and a county career dealing first-hand with air quality issues (and being
  a first responder and shelter manager in event of county-wide disaster) I am
  singularly qualified to comment on how ill prepared we are to contend with
  the negative consequences of global climate change.I am an advocate of Peace
  and of Indigenous rights and cultures (diversity value).<br>
  <br>
  I am committed to building the Green Party at the local, state, national and
  international levels (I just responded to a Japanese journalist supporting
  a mayoral candidate in Japan...so I'm now international in my outreach!)  </font></p>
