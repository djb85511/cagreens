  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  <strong><br>
  </strong>I am running for election for GPUS Delegate. I am on the national
  Steering Committee, one of the seven Co-chairs of GPUS. <br>
  <br>
  Here is a very brief history of my long involvement with the Green Party and
  the Green Politics Movement that led to it.<br>
  <br>
  I was a founder of the US Green Party and the CA Green Party. I was at the
  first 5 annual national Greens conferences, 1987-92. I was Co-chair of the
  GPUS Platform Committee. Many of you know that I have been very active working
  on our state platform. <br>
  <br>
  I was a full-time volunteer for Mark Satin's New World Alliance in 1980. (Mark
  later wrote the 10 Key Values.) I was the founder of the San Francisco Greens
  in 1985; helped to organize the Greening of the West Conference in 1988;
  and was one of the founders of the California Green Party in 1991. I was an
  elected member of the Alameda County GP County Council, 1992-94, 1996-2003
  and a member of the CA GP Coordinating Committee, 2001-3. I am currently a
  member of the Humboldt County GP County Council.<br>
  <br>
  I have extensive election campaign experience. I was the coordinator for Newark,
  NJ, for the 1972 McGovern for President Campaign. I worked in several Berkeley
  City Council &amp; mayoral campaigns; and was a candidate for Berkeley City
  Council in 1998, receiving almost 40% of the vote.<br>
  <br>
  I work as an Energy Conservation Engineer and have 25 years of work experience
  in government or semi-public agencies. I was involved in the Civil Rights Movement
  in the 1960's and helped elect the first black mayor of a major eastern city,
  Newark, NJ, in 1970, and served as an aide in his office. I have a Master of
  Public Administration degree and an MA in Psychology. I was involved in the
  Anti-Nuclear Movement and the Pro-feminist Men's Movement in the 1980s. I identify
  as bisexual.<br>
  <br>
  I am concerned about the destructive factionalism in the party that started
  at the 2004 presidential nominating convention in Milwaukee. I believe decisions
  on 2004 strategy by the GPUS and its presidential ticket were made based on
  a reading of the national political situation in 2004. They were made with
  the Green Party's best interests in mind and were made independent of the interests
  of the corporate parties. I support the recent effort of the Delegate Apportionment
  Committee to reform the National Committee and increase the number of delegates
  from larger and more active states, including CA.<br>
  <br>
  I said repeatedly while running for the SC that I am looking for common ground.
  That puts me in the middle of this conflict and I am getting criticized by
  both sides. I am looking for a style of politics, based on love instead of
  anger. Understanding and compassion; not angry confrontation. I am not opposed
  to confrontation, but I am opposed to angry confrontation. I am not opposed
  to anger either, but when anger comes from love it creates constructive confrontation.
  When someone shouts at me in anger and does not pause to let me respond, I
  can hear only the anger and not the content of what they are saying. I cannot
  respond constructively, only react with flight or fight.<br>
  <br>
  As GPUS Steering Committee Co-chair, I have focused in the last several months
  on party finances. GPUS is going through a severe financial crisis and I am
  looking for ways to alleviate a deteriorated fundraising effort and the need
  to cut expenses. I would appreciate any help or suggestions you might have. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">
