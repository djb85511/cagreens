  _____________________________________________________________<br>
  <br>
  I respectfully request your vote and support for continuity, maturity, responsibility
  and open communication as a CA Delegate. I have been on the CA Delegation to
  the GNC since its expansion to 13 Delegates in 2002, first as an Alternate,
  and then as a Delegate. I am very active with the Delegation, with a near 100%
  Voting Record on national proposals. I believe strongly in California's continued
  affiliation and conspicuous and seasoned presence in the Green Party of the
  United States. I was a Delegate at the Presidential Nominating Conventions
  in 2000 and 2004. I have been registered Green in CA since 1992.<br>
  <br>
  I take my responsibilities seriously as a delegate, and strive to attend monthly
  teleconferences, state plenaries and national meetings. I read my email and
  respond frequently on both the national and internal state delegation lists.
  I was chosen by the delegation to be &quot;Vote Nanny&quot; or Floor Manager,
  in order to keep track of the week-long votes, and ensure that the delegation
  uses our 13 Votes on every proposal, by empowering alternates to participate
  and vote. I am especially proud that the CA Delegation achieved 13 YES votes
  on the Delegate Apportionment Proposal, despite some early indications that
  there were concerns and we lacked consensus. I have been on GPUS Committees,
  including the Annual Meeting Committee, and currently on the 2008 Platform
  Committee. I am also a member of the GPUS Women's Caucus, the Lavender Caucus,
  and the Disability Caucus, and bring minority representation to balance the
  delegation.</font></p>
