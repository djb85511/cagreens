  <strong><br>
  1) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience, and/or personal
  and professional skills within of the Green Party that you have, that apply
  to this position.</strong><br>
  <br>
  I first registered Green in January 1990 when the ballot drive to start the
  current Green Party of California began; and I have been active on every level
  of the Green Party since November 1988, from
  my
  neighborhood
  to
  the global,
  and I remain so today. The list below is far from exhaustive, but gives a flavor
  of the range of activities that I have been involved in.<br>
  <br>
  - <strong>On the local level</strong>, I have been active since November 1988, when I joined
  the Westside Greens. Soon afterwards, my efforts in organizing the well attended
  Westside Green public forums of 1989-1990, helped springboard the Westside
  Greens from obscurity to public visibility and effect. While tabling on behalf
  of my local, I have registered a couple of thousand Green voters over the years.<br>
  <br>
  I have also represented the Westside Greens at national Green meetings in June
  1989 (Eugene, OR), March 1990 (San Diego), September 1990 (Estes Park, CO)
  and August 1991 (Elkins, WV).<br>
  <br>
  I remained active with the Westside Greens through 2004, when I then helped
  co-found a specific Santa Monica-focused local, the Santa Monica Greens, and
  remain active with the Santa Monica Greens today.<br>
  <br>
    - <strong>On the county level</strong>, I was the first county/regional Green office coordinator,
    from 1989-1991 and took care of county mail and phone for about seven out of
    ten years between 1989 and 1999.<br>
    <br>
    I was a co-founder of the Green Party Organizing Committee for Los Angeles
    County in 1990. After the Green Party of California gained ballot status in
    January 1992, I was elected to the first County Council in Los Angeles County
    in June 1992 and was re-elected every term since until 2002, when I took
    at two-year hiatus, only to return in 2004 and remain active through the
    present.
    In November 2004 I was also elected as the Co-coordinator of the Green Party
    of Los Angeles County, which I served til the end of my term in 2006.<br>
    <br>
    - On the state level, I am one of the party co-founders of the Green Party
    of California. I co-organized and co-facilitated the founding meeting of the
    state party. I gathered over 1,000 Green registrations myself during the 1990-1991
    Green Party ballot qualification drive.<br>
    <br>
    Since then, I have served on a variety of state committee and working groups,
    including Campaigns &amp; Candidates, Goals &amp; Strategies, By-Laws, Electoral
    Reform and International. I served on the GPCA State Coordinating Committee
    for six years, from 1995-2001 and returned in 2006, for a term that ends
    in March 2008. In<br>
    <br> 
    September of 2006, I was also elected as Co-Coordinator
    of the
    Coordinating Committee, based upon <a href="http://www.feinstein.org/greenparty/CC_Co_Co.htm">the
    following platform</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I also served on both of the GPCA's State Party Restructuring Committees (1992-1993,
    1999-2000).<br>
    <br>
    From 1994-1998, I was the GPCA's State Clearinghouse Coordinator. I served
    as a correspondent for the GPCA's first state newsletter (Green Consensus)
    in the early to mid 1990s and in recent years, have written for the GPCA's
    current state newsletter (Green Focus).<br>
    <br>
    I organized and hosted a GPCA state meeting (March 1990 @ LA Community College).
    I authored the proposal for the GPCA to join the national Green Party (November
    1999). And along the way, I have documented our GPCA state party history
    (<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/history">www.cagreens.org/history</a>).<br>
    <br>
    - On the national level, I have been active since 1989. I began by co-coordinating
    the national Green energy policy formation (1989-1990).<br>
    <br>
    I was a founding member of the national Green Party Organizing Committee
    (1990). I attended the founding meeting of the Association of State Green
    Parties (1996),
    which led to the current national Green Party of the United States. I have
    also been an invited speaker at the founding of state Green Parties in Minnesota
    (1994) and Texas (1999), as well as the Campus Green Network (2001).<br>
    <br>
    I was on the 1990 national Green Gathering '90 organizing committee (Estes
    Park, CO). In 1992, I was a member of the  Media Committee, Green Gathering
    '92 (Minneapolis, MN). In
    1996, I was co-coordinator (with Lynne Sepre) of the 1996 Green Gathering
    and Presidential Nomination Convention (at UCLA). In 2000,  I was a member
    of the Media Committee, ASGP Green Party National Convention (Denver, CO).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
             2001 I co-organized (with Stacy Malkan) , the <a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_30_01.html">press
             conference</a> to
             announce <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGZa8QFvkk">GPUS
             Founding and application</a> to FEC for Nat'l Committee
             Status,
             July 2001 (Santa Monica, CA). Overall, I&#8217;ve attended every
             annual national Green meeting in the U.S. since 1989 except
1993-1994<br>
          <br>
          In 1995, I co-negotiated the deal with two others for Ralph Nader to
          appear on the GPCA March 1996 presidential primary ballot, the first
          major steps
      to Nader becoming the Green Party's first presidential candidate.<br>
      <br>
      I organized both national Green officeholders conferences in the U.S. (1998
      and 2003, both in Santa Monica), as well as the first-ever gathering of
      Green candidates in the U.S. (<a href="http://www.feinstein.org/wlt/greenpartiesofthewest.html">Green
      Parties of the West,</a> 1993, also in
      Santa Monica).
      I was also a founding member of the national Green Officeholders Network.<br>
      <br>
      I was a correspondent for national Green publications Green Synthesis and
      Green Letter in the early 1990s. I was the founding editor of the national
      Green
      Party newsletter <a href="http://www.gp.org/greenpages/">GreenPages</a> from
      1997-2001 and continue today as the Sections Editor for both Electoral
      and International
      Green Party news.<br>
      <br>
      In 1999-2000, I negotiated 90% of what became to be known as the `Boston
      Agreement', which led the way to consolidating different factions in the
      national Green
      movement into what became the Green Party of the United States. I simultaneously
      served for several years on the national Transition Committee, which established
      the structure on how state Green Parties are represented on the national
      level.<br>
      <br>
      I have maintained national candidate and officeholder for U.S. Greens since
      1994 and have done the party's definitive election history back to 1985,
      which is on display at <a href="http://www.greens.org/elections">www.greens.org/elections</a>,
      a national Green website which I help administer. I also coordinate information
      and administer the U.S.
      Green national media site <a href="http://www.greens.org/media">www.greens.org/media</a> and
      the U.S. Greens ballot status and voter information site <a href="http://www.greens.org/stats">www.greens.org/stats</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Today I am an advisor to several national Green Party working groups, including
      Media, International, Coordinated Campaigns and Annual National Meeting.<br>
      <br>
      - <strong>On the international level</strong>, I was a founding member
      of the U.S. Green International Working Group in 1989 and have been active
      on the international Green level
      ever since.<br>
      <br>
      I've attended more international Green meetings than any other U.S. Green,
      representing both the Green Party of California and the U.S. Greens at
      international Green meetings on numerous occasions. In the early 1990s,
      I played an integral
      role in establishing the credibility of U.S. Greens in the international
      Green community, visiting and corresponding with numerous European Greens
      in particular.<br>
      <br>
      My first role as a formal U.S. Green representative overseas was June 1990
      at the <a href="http://www.feinstein.org/greensynthesis/eceasteuropeeurogreens.html">European
      Green Coordination meeting in Brussels </a>.
      In 2001, I was one of three U.S. Green delegates to the <a href="http://www.global.greens.org.au">Global
      Green meeting in Canberra, Australia</a>, where I cast one of three U.S.
      Green votes in favor of the first Global Green Charter.<br>
      <br>
      In 1991, I was part of the organizing committee for the first CANAMEX meeting
      (Greens from Canada, U.S. and Mexico) and was active in the founding
      of its successor, the <a href="http://www.fpva.org.mx">Federation of the
      Green Parties of the Americas</a>.
      More recently, I attended Federation meetings that coincided with the founding
      of the Green Party in the Dominican Republic (December 2002) and Nicaragua
      (November 2003).<br>
      <br>
      I've written a 674-page book on European Greens (Sixteen Weeks with European
      Greens: Interviews, Impressions, Platforms and Personalities) and am currently
      working on a second international Green book, on the role of Green Parties
      in coalition governments around the world.<br>
      <br>
      I currently serve as an advisor to the U.S. Green International Committee,
      and most recently I was a keynote international speaker at the August 2006
      Green Party of Canada national convention, as is documented in these three
      videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weycKK9DgsI">one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmDSH-Nu05E">two</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sycj7vjDhs%20">three</a>).<br>
      <br>
      - On the global level, I have been active since 1990, when I put forward
      the first written proposal regarding global Green cooperation and coordination,
      which I presented in Bonn, West Germany at the meeting of the European
      Green
      Coordination in 1990.<br>
      <br>
      I was part of the international effort to organize the <a href="http://www.globalgreens.info/eventpages/rio1992_finalstatement.html">first
      Global Green meeting</a>,
      held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
      I was an advisor to the first Global Green Steering Committee (1992-1994),
      including in my role creating the first Global Green Calendar, writing
      for the first Global Green newsletter and helping co-create and coordinate
      the
      first international Green email lists in the early 1990s.<br>
      <br>
      Today I am a member of the Global Greens Technical Advisory Group, which
      is responsible for the <a href="http://www.globalgreens.info">Global Greens
      website</a>, for
      which I am webmaster. I am also a member of the Global Greens History Working
      Group and in this role, am writing a comprehensive global history section
      of Green Parties around the world all the way back to 1972.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I am part of the twenty-member Global Green planning committee
      for the next Global Greens meeting, scheduled for May 2008, and towards
      that end,
      participate in monthly conference calls and organize the GG2008 information/registration
      page. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>2) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience, and/or
      personal and professional skills outside of the Green Party that you have,
      that apply to this position.</strong><br>

      <br>
      <strong>3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing
      the job description for GPUS Delegate. </strong><br>
      <br>
      I want to ensure that our state party is well represented at the national
      level and that our national party grows as well, including by sharing skills
      and information with state parties not as well developed as California.<br>
      <br>
      To ensure greater accountability between our delegation and the GPCA membership,
      I would work to ensure that all GPCA members who wish to know what decisions
      are before the national party, would have easy access to that information.
      As a member of the GPLAC County Council, I authored a proposal to this
      effect, and would encourage our delegation to pursue a similiar course:<br>
      <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/lacounty/2006-06/greennatlcmtecommunicate.html"><font size="3"><br>
          www.cagreens.org/lacounty/2006-06/greennatlcmtecommunicate.html</font></a><font size="3"><br>
          <br>
          PROPOSAL: That the County Council forward the following request to
            the Green National Committee of the Green Party of the United States<br>
          The Green Party of Los Angeles County requests that the Green Party
            of the United States<br>
          - develop a means by which rank-and-file members of the Green Party
            can receive automated information about what decisions are before the
            Green National Committee (including by email)<br>
          - develop a means by which rank-and-file members of the Green Party
            can express their opinions about decisions before the Green National
            Committee (including perhaps a format like that created by the GPLAC
          for the June GPCA General Assembly)<br>
          <br>
          Pending this, I would support the GPUS delegation automatically forwarding
          all such information out to interested GPCA members via the GPCA County
          Contacts list, or some other appropriate mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, GPCA Bylaws include the possibility for the GPCA General Assembly
          to instruct the GPUS delegation on national issues. I would work with
          the GPUS delegation to present for inclusion in the GPCA Work Plan,
          appropriate times/issues to bring to the General Assembly for its
          input.<br>
