  <strong>BIO:</strong><br>
  -- Early 1992, registered Green shortly after it attained ballot status<br>
  -- 1992, elected to the first Green Party County Council in Alameda County;
  served two years; helped edit and manage the Green Consensus newspaper; active
  with the Women's Caucus both locally and at the state level.<br>
  -- 1990s and 2000s, remained a Green registrant and supporter, employed at
  environmental and women's organizations and as a union staffer, while focusing
  on community-building in my living situations.<br>
  -- 2001, began campaign for State Controller in the first ever full slate of
  candidates running for statewide partisan office in California.<br>
  -- March 2002 primary, won contested primary election; elected to the County
  Council inadvertently (due to election officials entering statewide candidates
  as County Council candidates); active on the Outreach Team; organized a long-running
  weekly registration table at the local Farmers Market; helped institute monthly
  Green Sunday events.<br>
  -- November 2002 Controller election I earned 6% of the vote and got the most
  votes ever received in any Green Party partisan election in California<br>
  -- December 2002, co-founded the statewide newspaper, Green Focus, which I
  co-edited for six issues<br>
  -- May 2005, ran for and was elected to the GPCA Coordinating Committee as
  an at-large representative. One goal of my tenure was to hold state-wide gatherings
  again, and in September 2005 we held a gathering in Oakland.<br>
  -- 2006, ran a three-part campaign, (1) for State Controller; (2) to achieve
  voter approval of Instant Runoff Voting in Oakland; and (3) to do what I could
  to make the Green Party the most functional political party in the state. When
  the CC was unable to schedule its annual retreat officially, I organized a
  facilitated retreat to address important issues, and invited CC members, Green
  Party of the U.S. delegates, and co-coordinators of the working groups and
  standing committees.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>GOALS AS A GPUS DELEGATE:</strong><br>
  My goal in running for the position of CA delegate to the GPUS is to work toward
  having the Green Party be as functional as possible. I have begun a course
  of study on how to keep an organization/movement on track and moving forward,
  rather than being &quot;divided and conquered&quot;. It is possible, and certainly
  necessary, for Green values to become strong in the U.S. as we work together
  to create a better world. I want to be a part of the group that makes that
  happen.</font></p>
