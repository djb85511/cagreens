          <p>A Green voter since I was eligible to vote, I am committed to the
            full political independence of the Green Party and strongly believe
            that we should run the strongest possible campaigns for every office.
            I<br>
            believe that the GPUS must move closer to 'one Green one vote' if
            it is to become an increasingly powerful political force for grassroots
            democracy. Likewise, if we hope to change the system we find ourselves
            in, we must not shy away from questioning it at its root. We must
            move beyond capitalism if we are to ever live in a world based on
            our values.</p>
          <p><br>
            I have been active at all levels of the party, including the Green
              Party of Sonoma County's County Council, the GPCA Coordinating
              Committee,
            and the GPUS National Committee. I served as Co-Coordinator of the
              GPCA Coordinating Committee. I also belong to the GPUS's Presidential
            Campaign Support Committee and the Greens for Democracy and Independence.
            In August 2005 I received a Bachelor of Arts Magna
            Cum Laude in Political Science With Distinction from Sonoma
            State University. My senior thesis focused on the role of third parties
            in recent US
            history and their potential for future successes.</p>
          <p><br>
            This past fall I began my studies at University of the Pacific, McGeorge
              School of Law in Sacramento. As a result, I am less able to participate
              than I used to be, and am not able to be on all of the delegation
              conference calls. However, I am able to remain involved by email
              to a large degree. And others are encouraging me to seek
            re-election despite my time constraints. So if you are willing to
            re-elect me
            with this understanding, I am willing to continue
            to serve in the interests of having a strong CA delegation to GPUS.
            Please re-elect me to the GPCA's delegation to the GPUS so that I
            can help
            work to make the GPUS a stronger alternative to the current political
            system and a living example of our key value of grassroots
            democracy. </p>
