          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am currently a member
              of the GPOMendocino County Council, and a Green candidate for Congress
              in CA District 1. In the latter capacity, I am contacting Greens
              in each county of District 1, for ballot access signature gathering
              and for getting out the vote. I've recruited a total of 20 people
              in Humboldt and Mendocino counties to call voters on the Green
              lists. I'm using my candidacy to build a Congressional District
              1 Green organization and attract more voters to the Green party<br>

            2) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience,

</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
In '06 and now, I am organizing Green candidates for Congress across the country
    into coalitions- the Longhouse Coalition and the New Broom Coalition. Both
    these coalitions, which have some overlap, include independents, progressive
    Democrats, and people of other parties, so that we can work together across
    party lines. Most candidates are Greens.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3) Please describe
                your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing
              the job description for GPUS Delegate.</strong><br>
            <br>
            I believe we can best build the Green party and serve the public
            by concentrating on Congressional races this year, and offering voters
            a real alternative to the Dem- Repug machine, a national slate of
            strong Green candidates, who can campaign together. We can use slogans
            like &quot;GRASSROOTS ARE GREEN&quot; &quot;FOR A GREEN FUTURE, VOTE
            GREEN&quot;, &quot;FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, VOTE GREEN&quot;. One
            Green in Congress can't do much, but 50 House members and a few Senators
            would radically change the dynamics in Washington. <br>
            <br>
            The Longhouse and New Broom Coalitions already have close to 50 candidates.
            If we publicize a slate of Green candidates, we can make the Green
            party more credible, more appealing to voters, more viable. We can
            win, if we all work together, and help our presidential candidate
            as well.<br>
            <br>
            As a GPUS delegate, I would push for a national campaign to support
            all Greens running for national office, as a major focus this election
            year.<br>
