            1) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience,
            and/or personal and professional skills within of the Green Party
            that you have, that apply to this position.<br>
            </strong><br>
            I have been an observer to the National Green party listserv since
            2004. I was active with the Milwaukee Greens and Wisconsin Green
            Party from 2000-2004 but never held any leadership positions with
            either body.  <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience,
            and/or personal and professional skills outside of the Green Party
            that you have, that apply to this position.</strong><br>
            <br>
I coordinated the technology for the 2004 Nominating Convention in Milwaukee,
which included the computers and internet for the office as well as the computers
which ran the display during the voting portion of the convention. This included
working with Susan Dridi of Virginia and Cameron Spitzer of California to get
the software needs met for the voting.  <strong><br>
<br>
            3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including
          addressing the job description for GPUS Delegate.<br>
</strong><br>
  I am mostly interested in seeing the GPUS fulfill its goal of growth in 2008,
    and making sure that the national body is not seen as a dysfunctional operation.
    I wish to start as an alternate to the GNC because I do not know if I have
    the time to be a full delegate at this moment.  </p>
