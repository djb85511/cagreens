  An NC Delegate from California needs to represent the concerns of California
    Greens within the National Committee both organizationally and politically;
    an NC delegate needs to recognize the decisions of the leadership bodies of
    the GPCA; an NC member needs to maintain the necessary decorum within the NC
    to address resolutions and proposals, sponsor them as directed by the state
    Green Party and make proposals that can be reviewed by state and county bodies
    of the party; an NC member needs to support the campaign efforts of the Presidential
    nominee as determined by the nominating convention of the GPUS, an NC representative
    needs to assure adequate representation of the needs and concerns of California
    Greens internally and increase the financial viability and organizational integrity
    of the GPUS, an NC delegate needs to work with other California state delegates
    in addressing proposals and resolutions before the NC; an NC delegate needs
    to communicate with other delegates in the review and evaluation of actions
    before the NC in a professional manner that upholds the integrity of the decision-making
    process; an NC delegate represents his or her own views in such a way as to
    promote unity while forthrightly representing GPCA and not sacrificing the
    ethical responsibility for my own individual accountability in upholding the
    Ten Key Values and an NC delegate needs to respect divergent views within the
    GPCA and the National Committee.</p>
