I have been  a Green Party member for about 12 years. I have served three-2 year terms as  an elected county council member and have attended over a dozen state meetings  as a delegate from my county and have served on the state credential committee  twice and participated in delegate election committees four times.<br>  <br>  I attended my first national meeting in Washington, DC as an observer. I was  a nominating convention delegate at the Milwaukee presidential convention and  that December ran as an alternate to the GPCA delegation and in May 2005 ran  as a delegate. I attended annual meetings in Tulsa and Tucson and then was  elected as the delegation co-chair. I was re-elected to the delegation in May  2007 and reelected as co-chair at our first state meeting after attending the  national meeting in Philadelphia. I attended the 2008 Presidential Convention  and Annual National meeting in Chicago and at that meeting, I was elected as  one of the seven co-chairs of GPUS.<br>  <br>  I am a member of the International Committee and the National Women&#8217;s  Caucus, and have served as its webmaster.<br>  <strong><br>  2) Please list any prior or current positions, related experience, and/or personal  and professional skills outside of the Green Party that you have, that apply  to this position.</strong><br>  <br>  In the rest of my life, I am a teacher (active in my union at the local (webmaster),  state, and national level), permaculture designer, political/social activist  since the 70's, and co-creator of the San Mateo Ecovillage. See www.greensolutions.org  for more about me. I think of myself as a planetary citizen, love to travel,  and am fortunate that my husband works for United Airlines. I look forward  to retiring in 2009 so that I can be a full-time activist.<br>  <br>  <strong>3) Please describe your vision for serving as GPUS Delegate including addressing  the job description for GPUS Delegate.</strong><br>  <br>  I think my record speaks to this question.</font></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
