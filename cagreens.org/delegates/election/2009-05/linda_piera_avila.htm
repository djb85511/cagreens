I am a 28 year resident of Santa Monica. I havebeen registered Green since 1990.<br>ACTIVISM:<br><br>I participated in the planning of the 1996 Green Party convention, held at UCLA,at which Ralph Nader was first nominated by the party to run on its ticket forpresident. I was a delegate for Mr. Nader in 2000 and more recently, for CynthiaMcKinney in 2008.<br><br>I have at various times been an active member of different Green locals, includingthe Los Angeles Greens and the Santa Monica Greens. I have previously servedas secretary and as events coordinator for the Los Angeles Greens and am currentlymost active with that local.<br><br>Along with other Greens, I participated in the early days of the &quot;ArlingtonWest&quot; Iraq War memorial, held every Sunday on Santa Monica Beach. I haveparticipated in numerous peace marches and rallies. I coordinated the Los AngelesGreens Earth Day event in 2005 at which we hosted Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler.I joined with other LA Greens to lobby LA City Council members to adopt STV votingmethods.<br><br>I have volunteered on numerous Green campaigns, including Mike Feinstein's, KevinMcKeown's, and Byron DeLear's campaigns. This was good experience when I threwmy hat in the ring and ran for Santa Monica City Council in 2008 (www.linda-piera-avila.org).<br>I have supported lobbying efforts in Sacramento to promote the Campaign for OldGrowth and tabled many, many hours to collect signatures on the petition forsaid initiative.<br><br>In May/June of 2006 I participated in the encampment of the South Central Farm,providing a Green Party presence and liaison. I was quoted in a state press releaseregarding this issue. I currently serve on the Leadership Council of the SouthCentral Farmers.In September of 2006 I was part of a 5 member Green Party contingentthat joined a larger 300 person civil disobedience action, all undergoing arrestand overnight incarceration for the sake of promoting a living wage for underpaidhotel workers in the LAX hotel corridor.I currently serve on the board of thePico Neighborhood Association in Santa Monica and am an active member of Treesavers,a group of concerned residents working to preserve the tree canopy in Santa Monica.<br><br>PREVIOUSDELEGATE EXPERIENCE:<br><br>I served as a delegate to the following state plenaries: May 2005 in Sylmar,May 2007 in San Francisco, Sept., 2007 in Riverside, Sept., 2008 in Dana Point.Atthis time I would like to assist the GPCA and serve as an alternate nationaldelegate to the GPUS.<br></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">          </font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
