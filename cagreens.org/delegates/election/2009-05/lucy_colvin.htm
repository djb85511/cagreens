During part of this time, I was an at large representative    to the CA Green party state coordinating committee, 1 1&#8260;2 years    of which I was co-coordinator of the Coordinating Committee from 2000-2001.    During the time I served as at large representative, I was coordinator of    the restructuring committee out of which the first Coordinating Committee    co-coordinator positions evolved, myself being one of them. Though    I am not involved currently as a county council member or state    representative, I have been involved in numerous political and initiative    campaigns since then and have remained supportive and interested    in Green Party activities, including being a monthly/quarterly donor    to both the CA state and my San Francisco local.<br>    <br>    I think it is important for the survival and viability of the Green Party    to have strong local, state, and national structures. To that end I desire    to    serve as a national alternate member of California's delegation.<br>        </font></p></td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
