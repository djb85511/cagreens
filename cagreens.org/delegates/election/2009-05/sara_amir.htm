I was the Green Party candidate for Lieutenant Governor  in 1998, receiving a quarter of a million votes and a candidate for the 42nd  State Assembly District in 2000 receiving 10% of the votes in a largely Democratic  district.<br>  <br>  Twenty five (25) years of working for the California Environmental Protection  Agency has given me experience in understanding legislation, administration  and negotiation. <br>  <br>  I was born and educated in Iran, earned a B.S. degree in Biology from the University  of Tehran and a Master's Degree in Environmental Engineering from the University  of Southern California. Upon returning to Tehran after graduation, I worked  to promote democracy and women's rights under the newly formed Islamic Republic  of Iran. I returned to the US in 1981 when conditions became intolerable for  many activists and intellectuals, and started a new life in California.<br>  <br>  I was elected to the KPFK Local Station Board in 2003, and have been the CAL/EPA  designee on the Baldwin Hills Conservancy Board since 2000.<br>  <br>  I strongly believe in the 4 pillars of the Green Party and committed to the  10 key values. I also believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to positively  affect the Green Evolution/Revolution. </font></p>      </td><br>    </tr>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
