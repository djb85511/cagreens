NOTES:

------------------------------------------
(05) Decision: Approval of prior month's minutes (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Co-Coordinator
*Proposal*: Approve the minutes for the June 5th meeting as recorded by Mimi Newton (w/suggested revisions per Sanda Everette)
*Reference*: http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-06-05

NOTES:

Mike Feinstein added his standing concern about the legitimacy of Ann Menasche. "Ann Menasche was not elected to the GPCA Coordinating Committee because write-in voting is not provided for in GPCA bylaws, nor has it ever been used nor counted in the GPCA's history for at-large Coordinating Committee seats <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_8-4_Elections">http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_8-4_Elections</a>; and because advocates for seating Ann Menasche failed to propose a bylaws interpretation under Article 13 of GPCA Bylaws that would have allowed this, which is the only procedure under party rules for which such write-in votes could be allowed <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Article_13-3_Bylaws_Interpretation">http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Article_13-3_Bylaws_Interpretation</a>."

Mike Goldbeck also added an outstanding concern as to the legitimacy of Ann Menasche.  "Ann Menasche was elected to the GPCA Coordinating Committee because the write-in vote is not forbidden by the GPCA Governing Documents.  A Bylaws Interpretation was voted upon and the results were to put Ann Menasche back on the ballot, which was not done. So, the SGA used the write-in method and overwhelmingly voted for Ann Menasche to be elected to the GPCA Coordinating Committee."

Approved by consensus.

------------------------------------------
(06) Announcement: Consent Calendar (0 minutes)

There is no consent calendar for this month. However the item is included here to maintain continuity for future meetings.


------------------------------------------
(07) Decision: Ratify Actions Surrounding the Latest SGA Election (15 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Susan Chunco 
*Proposal*: 

Regarding the June 5, 2017 Coordinating Committee Decision, which directed the SGA vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties to the SGA voting page no later than June 7, 2017, and regarding votes received from those delegates:

Whereas an agenda item was submitted to the Coordinating Committee (CC) listserve on or before May 29, 2017, which directed the Standing General Assembly (SGA) vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties, to the SGA voting page no later than by June 7, 2017; and

Whereas at least one SGA vote administrator is a member of the above-mentioned CC listserve, and

Whereas the Coordinating Committee (CC) acted upon the above-referenced agenda item and voted at its regular meeting held on June 5, 2017 to direct the SGA vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties to the SGA voting page no later than by June 7, 2017, and

Whereas the SGA vote administrators failed to add the above delegates to the SGA voting page by the June 7 deadline that was specified in the June 5 CC decision, and

Whereas on June 7 the above-referenced decision to add those delegates to the SGA voting page was posted to the CC listserve and on June 9 it was sent to all CC, it-help, and IT committee members, and

Whereas on June 14 CC member and GROW (Grassroots Organizing Working Group) Co-coordinator Laura Wells posted a message to a number of state party listserves, including the SGA 'votes' listserve, which informed delegates (including the SGA vote administrators) about the June 5 CC decision, and

Whereas the SGA vote administrators continued to not add the above delegates to the SGA voting page despite the above-referenced messages sent on June 7, June 9, and June 14, and

Whereas at no time after the postings of any of the above messages did any SGA vote administrator post a message to the CC listserve or to any other relevant listserve regarding why the delegates discussed above would not be added (or had not been added) to the SGA voting page, and 

Whereas at no time after the postings of any of the above messages did any SGA vote administrator contact CC co-chair Bert Heuer regarding why the delegates discussed above would not be added (or had not been added) to the SGA voting page, and

Whereas CC co-chair Bert Heuer, upon realizing that the SGA vote administrators were failing to carry out the above-referenced June 5 CC decision to add the delegates discussed above, implemented an arrangement with Liaison to the Secretary of State Jared Laiti to receive the votes of the delegates discussed above, per the previous CC precedent of Mr. Laiti having received the votes of CC members, and arranged via Green Party volunteer Greg Jan to have FairVote merge the votes sent to Jared Laiti with the online votes cast, and then count the combined votes, per the 2016 precedent of having FairVote count GPCA votes, and

Whereas all ten (10) of the delegates discussed above were sent a message with information about the SGA vote and which notified them to send their vote to Jared Laiti no later than the June 25 deadline, and

Whereas nine (9) out of the ten (10) above delegates did submit their votes to Jared Laiti on or prior to the June 25 deadline, and

Whereas the combined vote totals for ID 128, ID 129, ID 131, and ID 132 are a follows:  for ID 128: 110 'Yes' votes, zero (0) 'No' votes, and 2 abstentions;  for ID 129:  74 'Yes' votes, 37 'No' votes, and 1 abstention;  for ID 131: 99 'Yes' votes, 3 'No' votes, and 10 abstentions;  and for ID 129:  12 'Yes' votes, 90 'No' votes, and 10 abstentions (and the results for the combined votes for ID 124 through ID 127 are currently being processed by FairVote and should be available prior to the July 10 CC meeting); and

Whereas the above-referenced June 5 decision of the CC intended for the above delegates to be able to participate in the SGA election for which nine (9) of the delegates did submit their votes to Jared Laiti following the failure of the SGA vote administrators to carry out the above-referenced June 5 CC decision to add those delegates to the SGA voting page,

Therefore be it resolved that the Coordinating Committee hereby adopts the following proposal:

That the CC finds that CC co-chair Bert Heuer, upon realizing that the SGA vote administrators were failing to carry out the above-referenced June 5 CC decision to add the delegates discussed above, did in fact act appropriately in arranging with Liaison to the Secretary of State Jared Laiti to receive the votes of the delegates discussed above, and also in arranging with FairVote to merge and count the votes, and

That the resulting totals referenced above as well as the totals which will result from the processing of the votes in Attachment #2 below that are being counted by FairVote are in fact the true results for those elections, since they incorporate the votes from the counties which were authorized to vote in the June 5 CC decision, and

That CC co-chair Bert Heuer will promptly arrange to notify the SGA "votes" listserve of these true results.

*References*: Appendix A..E

NOTES:

Tim Laidman spoke with his concerns about decisions of the Coordinating Committee.

Mike F asked about the money that went to Kern County. Tim responded that money was improperly sent to Kern County that was first delivered to GPCA.

Susan C asked about Tim's comment "spirit of the bylaws".  Tim rehashed the Ann Menasche controversy.

Susan presented the item and read the "therefore" section of the proposal.

Sanda expressed an outstanding concern that the CC "made up its own rules".

Eric Rydberg stated that at the Kern county GA there was a bylaws change added that changed the requirements. Therefore the counties elected were legitimate

Bert stated that Ann Menasche was a Green at the time of her election and the record needed to be corrected.

Ann Menasche said she thought it was important that we have a party that is welcoming.  She said that the decisions made by the CC should be respected even if people disagree.

Sanda stated that she agreed with Ann

Eric R stated that the Kern decision was legitimate and that the change was made because Mike F would not send out noticed.  Sanda objected.

June tested for consensus. Sanda stood aside on her concern.  PASSED by consensus.


------------------------------------------
(08) Decision: Fundraising Committee Appointments (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks
*Proposal*: Add Eric Luna, Jim Smith, and Eric Frame to the roster of the Fundraising Committee.
*Reference*: Appendix F..I

Eric presented. And affirmed the bona fides of FOUR candidates. 

Bert stated that Colt Gonsalez' name was submitted on time even though his name does not appear in the agenda item.  This is a typo on Bert's part and shouldn't be held against Colt.

Eric Luna was approved by consensus

Sanda asked about gender balance.  Eric Brooks agreed that, yes, gender balance was an issue.  He stated that they wanted to get things started and later on they would out a call for women and people of color.

Jim Smith was approved by consensus

Eric Frame was approved by consensus

Colt Gonsalez was approved by consensus.



------------------------------------------
(09) Decision: Bylaws Interpretation/Authorize an Online Vote of the SGA (15 min)

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*:

According to the Delegate Apportionment Formula in Section 8-6 of GPUS Rules and Procedures Article VIII National Committee Size and Delegate Allocation, the Green Party of California (GPCA) is entitled to 25 delegates on the 150 member National Committee of the Green Party of the United States.

According to GPCA bylaws, the GPCA elects its GPUS delegates and alternates to staggered, two-year terms via the Standing General Assembly, during the same time period as elections to the GPCA Coordinating Committee.   The GPCA concluded its recent GPUS Delegation Delegate and Alternate Delegate elections on June 25, 2017.   

On or about March 26, 2017, announcements were transmitted to various Greens throughout the State via Nationbuilder and other means announcing the GPUS Delegate and Alternate Delegate elections.   This announcement included an April 24, 2017 deadline to submit an application to become a candidate for these elections.   The announcement indicated there were 13 Delegate seats up for election and 12 Alternate Delegate seats.   While more than 13 candidates competed for the 13 Delegate seats, only 9 candidates competed for the 12 Alternate Delegate seats.

Despite the March announcement of the deadline for candidates to apply being stated as April 24, 2017, the GPCA website contained a May 1 deadline.   Due to the conflicting deadlines, at least one candidate for GPUS Delegate, Rich (Zee) Zitola, of Santa Cruz County, submitted an application after the April 24 deadline, but before the May 1 deadline.   As a result, Zee was not included as a candidate in the election for GPUS Delegates that ended on June 25, 2017.

*Proposal*:

That the CC approve the following bylaws interpretation and authorize a special Standing General Assembly vote to simultaneously confirm this Bylaws interpretation and hold an election for Rich (Zee) Zitola as an Alternate Delegate to the GPUS.

-- WHEREAS an announcement was made setting a deadline for candidates to submit applications for GPUS Delegate and Alternate Delegate to the Green Party of the United States Delegation; and

-- WHEREAS the Green Party of California failed to update the deadline on its website to conform to the information on the announcement; and  

-- WHEREAS at least one candidate for the GPUS Delegate election (Zee Zitola) submitted their application before the deadline on the website, but not before the deadline on the announcement; and

-- WHEREAS less applicants (nine) filed for election as candidates for GPUS Alternate Delegate than seats for these spots existed (twelve), leaving 3 Alternate Delegate seats unfilled,  

THEREFORE, the Coordinating Committee finds that a special election can be called to allow the SGA to consider Zee Zitola's candidacy for GPUS Alternate Delegate, and that it should be for one week of discussion and one week of voting, with the discussion beginning on Monday, July 17, 2017 and the voting on Monday, July 24, 2017.   The Coordinating Committee also finds that, simultaneously, a separate special election shall be called in accordance with GPCA Bylaw 13-3 to allow the SGA to confirm this bylaws interpretation.

NOTES:

Mimi presented and mentioned Ahmed Eltouny.  She amended her proposal to include Ahmed Eltouny so that the discussion was about TWO delegate and not just Zee.

Tarik asked whether or not there were others who were confused about the deadlines for application. Mimi reponded that she did not know of others but that those two were the ones known.

Sanda stated that we should have accepted Mike's bylaws interpretation and that Zee should have responded sooner.

Mimi responded to Sanda that NationBuilder sent out many emails and overlooking that was forgiveable.

Tarik stated that he felt the process was not confusing.

June suggested that we vote affirmatively and we submit to the SGA.

Mimi restated the proposal (including Achmed E).

Sanda had an outstanding concern.  Standing aside.  Concern to be emailed later.

Tarik had an outstanding concern.  Standing aside. Concern to be emailed later.

PASSED by consensus.

(10) Decision: Responsibilities of Outgoing Treasurer (10 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Bert Heuer (on behalf of Finance Committee)
*Background*: The following letter was sent to Bert Heuer for submission to the entire CC.

To: GPCA Coordinating Committee,
Cc: Finance Chairperson Victoria Ashley,

As you know, I am scheduled to formally start as your new State Treasurer, effective today, July 1, 2017.   For over a month I have been trying to get the current Treasurer, Mr. Doug Barnett, whose term ends June 30, 2017, to assist with the following critical tasks -see below- to reasonably making this transition. So far Mr Barnett has not cooperated with the finance committee, myself, and others on transferring access, authorizations, and other documents in order for me to properly do my job.   In particular, the following critical tasks listed below, must be done. Unless Mr. Barnett follow up on the critical tasks listed below, I will not only not be able to properly do my job, but I also cannot risk exposing the organization and myself to legal liabilities which might result from not carrying out the functions and responsibilities. Mr Barnett typically does not reply to email   from me).

Per section 8-1 of the bylaws, the Coordinating Committee is authorized to help carry out the decisions of the GPCA General Assembly, including the transfer of documents, access, and authorizations for me to do my job, following the GA's ratification of me as its new GPCA Treasurer.   Therefore, I now ask for your help in facilitating this transition.   In particular, I ask that you please promptly get Mr. Barnett to take the actions listed below, so that I can then properly do the job which the GPCA General Assembly has confirmed that I should be doing.

Critical tasks which Mr Barnett needs to take:

- Ensure that no checks are written to "cash", which is against the law.   (Earlier this year, a number of checks were written to "cash".   I have asked Mr. Barnett to ensure that this never again takes place, but thus far he has not replied back to me about this).
- Work with me on transferring our current credit union accounts to a different credit union which has branches in both northern and southern California.   (The current credit union only has branches in southern California).
- Agree that neither he, nor any of the other current signers on the existing credit union account will be signers on the new account, at the new credit union.   (I am in the process of confirming other Greens who will be signers, along with me, on the new account).
- Work with me so I can access Statecraft, which is the program which we use for recordkeeping, to assist in filing the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) reports.
- Work with me so I can access Nationbuilder, which is the program which we use to manage our donors, and which we use to do fundraising.
- Transfer to me all other records and information which I might need to file FPPC reports.
- Transfer to me all other records and information which I might need to properly carry out all other work of the GPCA Treasurer.

Sincerely,

Ruscal Cayangyang
State Treasurer
Green Party of California

*Proposal*: The Coordinating Committee insists that Doug Barnett submit any and all paperwork to Ruscal Cayangyang within 14 business days of this meeting.

Sanda pointed out that the credit union has offices in Northern CA.  And that access to NationBuilder was never granted to Doug.

Bert responded that the proposal did not hinge on the exact wording of the letter from Ruscal.

Laura wanted a list of paperwork given, accounts, etc.  She proposed ""

Eric B affirmed the proposal

Victoria said that when Doug took over Jeannie Rosenmier helped with the transition and that Doug was not doing that.  Also that Tim Laidman has been helpful.

Sanda: credit union was with Provident. Tim and Sanda opened the account. Doug never used the credit union.

Amended proposal is 

"The Coordinating Committee insists that Doug Barnett and Tim Laidman submit any and all paperwork to Ruscal Cayangyang within 14 business days of this meeting. Proposed also that Doug and Tim provide and post to the CC email list and to the Finance Committee email list, and that Ruscal acknowledge receipt of:

List of all bank accounts that have any money in them.
List of all signers
List all addresses of the final institutions.

List what Doug and Tim have turned over to Ruscal, reach an agreement about what was turned over and what was received."

Amended proposaL PASSED by consensus

(11) Decision: Censure for SGA Vote Administrators (25 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Bert Heuer
*Proposal*: 

Proposal to "censure" the SGA vote administrators for not carrying out the June 5, 2017 Coordinating Committee Decision, which directed the SGA vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties to the SGA voting page no later than by June 7, 2017:
 
Whereas an agenda item was submitted to the Coordinating Committee (CC) listserve on or before May 29, 2017, which directed the Standing General Assembly (SGA) vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties, to the SGA voting page no later than by June 7, 2017; and
 
Whereas at least one SGA vote administrator is a member of the above-mentioned CC listserve, and
 
Whereas the Coordinating Committee (CC) acted upon the above-referenced agenda item and voted at its regular meeting held on June 5, 2017 to direct the SGA vote administrators to add delegates from Ventura, Santa Cruz, Mendocino, and other counties to the SGA voting page no later than by June 7, 2017, and
 
Whereas the SGA vote administrators failed to add the above delegates to the SGA voting page by the June 7 deadline that was specified in the June 5 CC decision, and
 
Whereas on June 7 the above-referenced decision to add those delegates to the SGA voting page was posted to the CC listserve and on June 9 it was sent to all CC, it-help, and IT committee members, and
 
Whereas on June 14 CC member Laura Wells posted a message to a number of state party listserves, including the SGA 'votes' listserve, which informed delegates (including the SGA vote administrators) about the June 5 CC decision, and
 
Whereas the SGA vote administrators continued to not add the above delegates to the SGA voting page despite the above-referenced messages sent on June 7, June 9, and June 14, and
 
Whereas at no time after the postings of any of the above messages did any SGA vote administrator post a message to the CC listserve or to any other relevant listserve regarding why the delegates discussed above would not be added (or had not been added) to the SGA voting page, and 
 
Whereas at no time after the postings of any of the above messages did any SGA vote administrator contact CC co-chair Bert Heuer regarding why the delegates discussed above would not be added (or had not been added) to the SGA voting page, and
 
Whereas the failure of the SGA vote administrators to carry out the above-referenced June 5 CC decision to add the above delegates to the SGA voting page caused much extra work for a number of CC members and others with whom they consulted with (including making arrangements with Jared Laiti and FairVote so that the votes of the above delegates could get counted), and
 
Whereas the work of the Green Party of California (GPCA) is severely handicapped when the SGA vote administrators fail to carry out CC decisions and fail to even communicate about CC decisions that they are not carrying out,   
 
Therefore be it resolved that the Coordinating Committee hereby adopts the following:
 
The current SGA Vote Administrators are hereby censured for deliberately refusing to carry out the properly and clearly expressed will of the Coordinating Committee as to the handling of the most recent Standing General Assembly elections, for failing to communicate their unwillingness to carry out that will, and for their refusal to assist or allow any other person to carry out that will in their stead. These refusals caused hardship for the Coordinating Committee, for members of the Standing General Assembly, and for the Liaison to the Secretary of State. Such behavior is unacceptable in persons holding positions of responsibility within our political party.

NOTE:

Bert restated the proposal.

Eric stated that this is not the first time the SGA Vote administrators have ignored the rules in the past. Eric wanted the text altered to include "and in past SGA elections".

Laura stated that she did not feel that including past elections

Ann said "I do support this" and that our party officers and whatnot should follow our rules.

Sanda stated that she 

Mica agreed that they should be censured for disobeying direct orders from the CC.

Bert read the proposal

Eric Brooks expressed a concern (given here) and stood aside. "I will stand aside with the concern that I would have preferred that the item censuring the SGA Vote Administrators had also referenced their past actions as SGA Administrators when they 1) improperly interfered with the 2016 Coordinating Committee candidacies of both David Curtis and Ann Menasche, 2) improperly interfered with the 2016 Green Party presidential candidacy of Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry (the only woman of color in the 2016 Green primary, 3) improperly interfered with SGA and other GPCA emails in attempted discussions of all of these cases, and 4) defied the will and decisions of the Coordinating Committee, GA and SGA in all of these cases."

Sanda had an outstanding concern.  She is willing to stand aside.

PASSED by consensus.


------------------------------------------
(12) Adjourn

NOTE:

Mimi asked about our standing "rule" that the committee's send in their monthly reports. 

Eric stated that in our next meeting that there are people suing Government about reapportioning Congressional districts.  The litigants are asking whether we - as a party - would like to join the lawsuit.  For the next agenda.

Sanda stated she thought June did a fine job as facilitor.  Many twinkles.

Bert stated that he wanted to add the committee reports to the consent calendar.

Laura stated sending in meeting minutes for committees was a good idea.

Ann apologized for no reports from ERWG.

Mimi stated that the Congressional lawsuit was something that Marin was added to in the past.

Sanda: I was Media Committee liaison before.  Would like to be again.

June: CCWG. We should have a list of the committee membership and liaisons.  She would be willing to step down from her liaison duties for CCWG. If anyone else wants to do the liaison work, then they should apply.

Eric again mentioned that we need women and people of color on the fundraising committee.  Diversity is important.

Next meeting: Aug 7th, 2017

June 14, 2017 email message to the "gpca-votes" listserve from GROW co-coordinator Laura Wells entitled "Adding all SGA delegates now", containing info on SGA delegates not being added to the SGA voting pages:

On Wednesday, June 14, 2017 2:25 PM, Laura Wells <laurawells510> wrote:
[gpca-votes] Adding all SGA delegates now
 
Hello everyone,

As GROW (Grassroots Organizing Working Group) co-coordinator and liaison to the CC (state Coordinating Committee), I need to address a matter that affects GROW's mission to support the growth of active county organizations. 

We would like to proactively deal with a problem so that it can be understood and handled in the days leading up to this weekend's General Assembly. Our face-to-face time is too valuable to be spent in an unnecessary "floor fight" â€” as happened so many times in the old days. There are many other crucial things we can be doing to move the Green Party and green values forward.

I will send this email to all people and lists concerned with getting every county-appointed Standing General Assembly (SGA) delegate properly added to the email list, voting pages, and webpage (http://sga.cagreens.org/vote/contacts?cid=13). The affected counties include Ventura, Santa Cruz, and Mendocino, and possibly others. Concerned people and lists include GROW, the CC, SGA, IT Committee, registrants of the General Assemblies, and GPCA-forum (sorry for duplicate emails you may receive!). The intention is to have -- not a flame war or a floor fight -- but rather a result in which the SGA is updated fully and properly.

Here's the proposal that was approved, by consensus with one stand-aside, at the most recent monthly CC teleconference on June 5, 2017. The decision was noticed to all CC members on June 7, and again on June 9 to the CC, it-help, and all IT committee members.

    This proposal recommends that the Coordinating Committee direct the SGA Vote Administrators to add the SGA Delegates for the foregoing Counties (Ventura and Santa Cruz) for the remaining 2016/2017 term, as identified above, to the SGA Email List, the SGA Voting Pages and the GPCA Pages identifying SGA Delegates from the Counties by no later than 48 hours after the adoption of this proposal. In addition, the same CC direction applies to other active counties that submit SGA delegates for the 2016/2017 term, including counties in the process of certification such as Mendocino County, and others whose SGA delegation allotment is not currently filled.

THE PROBLEM
Despite the CC's decision on June 5 to add the SGA Delegates within 48 hours, the requested changes have not been made. Other changes have been made to the lists since June 5. An important SGA vote is taking place now, including the elections of half of the CC members and half of California's delegates to the national party. The election is in the discussion phase, with voting to occur between Monday, June 19 and Sunday, June 25. The person who appears to be in sole control of making those changes is Mike Feinstein. He is not on the IT Committee, which is charged with providing technical support for GPCA web sites, data bases and email lists. The 8 appointed IT Committee members are: Bert Heuer (co-co and CC liaison), Ajay Rai (co-coordinator), and members Gerry Gras, Nicole Montoya, Sadie Fulton, Sanda Everette, Tim Laidman, and Trini Castaneda. Tim Laidman may also be able make the SGA changes.

THE SOLUTION
Add all active county-appointed SGA delegates now so that this does not consume time at the General Assembly. We will then be able to address at the GA the important matters of adopting an annual budget, moving forward on Committee and Working Group projects, being inspired by vital trainings, and hearing about and gaining understanding of success stories from around the state.

ACTION
You can help by respectfully (of course!) expressing your opinion on the matter.

Thank you for reading, and for participating in strengthening the Green Party of California.

Another world is possible,
Laura Wells
GROW co-coordinator and CC liaison

Greg,

I understand that you have been in touch with FairVote and are therefore prepared to communicate our raw voting data to them. Will you please, acting on behalf of the Coordinating Committee, send everything needed to FairVote and get a final tally?

Note that, if possible I would prefer to have the entire election "handled" by FairVote - by "entire" I specifically mean including the simple yes/no items. For consistency and to minimize any doubt as to results.

Thank you,

Application from Colt Gonzales

I currently serve as a Co-Coordinator of the San Joaquin County Green Party.  Like many newcomers to the Green party, I started becoming active in politics during the Bernie Sanders "democratic" primary campaign.  In June of 2016 I studied the Green Party's platform and registered myself as a Green and began to help organize the "Central Valley for Jill Stein 2016" campaign to promote Jill Stein for President in my area.  During the campaign for Jill, our group was contacted by Erik Rydberg and encouraged to create our county party.  Since then I've been working with my fellow council members and members of our local party to create a strong foundation for our local party to persist into the future.  An organization with goals of changing a county, a state, or a country requires a strong foundation from which to grow.  Strong fundraising should be considered a major part of that foundation because of the massive potential costs of outreach and running campaigns.  I don't have any formal training in fundraising activities but my goal on the committee would be to help build that foundation while staying true to our Green Party values.

Thank you for your consideration;

Application from Eric Frame

I am a Council Member of the Sacramento County Green Party. I am also currently running for office (State Senate) in California. I wish to be a part of the fundraising committee because I believe raising money is one of the most important aspects of running a campaign and a Political Party. I was a bit disappointed to find out about the lack of funds available for Green Candidates and in general. I would like to help raise money and I can provide innovative ideas to do so, such as Trivia events, and house parties. For the record, I like the idea of charging (voluntary) dues. Also, I have taken accounting classes in college, so I know how to maintain a budget.

Thanks for the consideration,

Future Senator Eric Frame

========================= Appendix H ================================
=====================================================================
Application from Eric Luna

I co-founded the San Joaquin County Green Party,  in my honest opinion we need money to get things done so fundraising is the most important job for us as a party.  Doing this without taking money from corporations is going to be a great task but as Bernie Sander showed us in the 2016 campaign it is possible to raise sizable amounts from small donations from everyday people.  What it comes down to is outreach to registered Greens and other progressives and revolutionaries.  I think I would bring an open mind and an out of the box way of thinking when it comes to fundraising.  I hope you will consider me for a seat on the Fundraising Committee.

I was a Union business agent working for SEIU and then AFSCME for 30 years. I was at the same time president of the Central Labor Council of Humboldt and Del Norte counties with a primary responsibility of raising funds for our projects including the support of various nonprofit organizations and to provide a no cost Labor Day Picnic for union members and friends of labor.  I did this for 20 years until retirement.
