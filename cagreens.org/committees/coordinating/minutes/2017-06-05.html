Note:  Sanda Everette joined the call at 7:40 pm.
  
------------------------------------------

2) Roles

    Facilitator: Bert Heuer
  Minutes taker: Mimi Newton
    Time keeper: Eric Brooks (Tarik Kanaana when Eric’s items come up)
  Vibes Watcher: Susan Chunco

------------------------------------------
3) Approval of agenda (10 min)

*Sponsor*: Co-Coordinator Bert Heuer
*Proposal*: Four parts:

Bert explained that he is proposing we approve the agenda in four parts:
1. Item 3-A would be to approve the latest version of the agenda as published.
2. Item 3-B would be to approve the late item relating to changes to the draft agenda for the GA (Item 11A)
3. Item 3-C would be to approve the late item regarding the changes to the CC meeting attendance and quorum call (Item 11B)
4.  Item 3-D would be to approve the late item regarding the strategic plan (Item 11C).  
Item 3-A
A question arose about pulling something off the consent calendar.  Bert says we can raise that when we get to that item on the agenda.  

No outstanding questions or concerns approved by consensus. 

Item 3-B
Adding late item 11A: Approval of GA Agenda changes
 
No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

Item 3-C
Adding late item 11B: Change to procedure for CC meeting attendance and quorum call

No outstanding questions or concerns approved by consensus.
 
Item 3-D
Adding late item 11C: Approve draft two-year plan

No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.
 
------------------------------------------

4) Decision: Approval of May 1st minutes (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Co-Coordinator
*Proposal*: Approve the minutes for the May 1st meeting as recorded by Mike Murphy
*Reference*: http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-05-01

No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.
------------------------------------------
5) Decision: Consent Calendar Items from Online Votes; Committee, Working Group, and Treasurers Reports (2 min)

*Sponsor*: Co-Coordinator
*Background*: These are all non-controversial items. PRIOR READING IS EXPECTED as there will be NO DISCUSSION. Any item may be removed by any Member (reasons are not required).  Removed items will be agendized at the end of the evenings agenda (as time allows) or taken up at some later meeting.  Once we have established the final "list", we will have a simple majority vote.
*Proposal*: Accept, as is, the following items into the minutes

- Results of Vote to Oppose the SB 775 Cap &amp; Trade bill
- Monthly Bylaws Committee Report to the GPCA Coordinating Committee - May 2017
- Results of Online Vote to Approve Agenda for General Assembly
- Approve Jared Laiti as Liaison to the Secretary of State for another two-year term

*References*: Appendix A (online vote results), Appendix B (Bylaws meeting), Appendix C (online vote results), Appendix F (Jared Laiti)

There was a discussion about the concept of a consent calendar and a request that, if there is any controversy about whether we can approve an item on a consent calendar, then we should just include these items as regular agenda items. Bert responded by pointing out that if we approve this by consensus, it will have the same weight as if we took each item as a regular agenda item.  On the other hand, if there are any outstanding questions or concerns we will consider each item separately anyway, and if there aren't any outstanding questions or concerns, it will be the same approving them at once as it would be to approve them by consensus one at a time. 

Laura Wells offered a friendly amendment to reword the last item to “nominate” instead of "approve" Jared Laiti as liaison to SOS office.

There was a discussion about, if the CC nominates Jared Laiti in this role, then his approval as liaison by the larger body will need to go on the agenda for the GA, which it already is.

The friendly amendment was accepted such that the last item was reworded:

- Results of Vote to Oppose the SB 775 Cap &amp; Trade bill
- Monthly Bylaws Committee Report to the GPCA Coordinating Committee - May 2017
- Results of Online Vote to Approve Agenda for General Assembly
- Nominate Jared Laiti as Liaison to the Secretary of State for another two-year term
 
Sanda Everette – has a concern about the CC making up its own rules. The CC has never had a consent calendar. The GA has a long history of having a consent calendar and she does believe that is a very good use of that strategy. Sanda is willing to stand aside.
 
No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.
 
------------------------------------------

6) Decision: Appointment to Bylaws Committee (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Victoria Ashley (5 minutes)
*Proposal*: Appointment of Adam Siegel to the Bylaws Committee
*Background/Purpose*: The Bylaws Committee is a Standing Committee that can have 8 appointed members (GPCA Bylaws 9-5.2 Membership) and there is now one vacancy on the Committee.  Adam Siegel, of Yolo County, has requested to join the Bylaws Committee and his application is below.
*References*: Appendix D

No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

------------------------------------------

7) Decision: Certify Mendocino County (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Laura Wells (GROW)
*Background and Purpose*: Appendix E contains the Meeting Minutes of the Mendocino County Green Party meeting on 5/21/17. Within those minutes are the County Council members, June GA delegates, and SGA (Standing General Assembly) delegates. The bylaws are already posted on the webpage http://cagreens.org/bylaws/county. One bylaws change was made at the meeting, noted in the minutes, and copied below.
*Proposal*: Certify Mendocino County as "Active".
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*:
*References*: Appendix E

There was a discussion about whether the State Bylaws had been met insofar as Mendocino's County Council meeting had been subject to the proper notice to Greens in the County. There was a discussion about what the State and County bylaws may require in terms of notice to registered Greens of a County Council meeting where members of a County Council will be appointed.
 
Sanda has an outstanding concern that the bylaws say the state party is supposed to notify everyone in the County and it doesn’t sound to her like that happened if only 3 people showed up and voted in a County Council meeting.  Sanda is also concerned that those bringing the proposal don't believe the bylaws require more notification from the state and that demonstrates that the required notice was not sent to the County's registered Greens.  She believes this is true for Santa Cruz and probably Ventura as well.  Sanda is willing to stand aside.

No other outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

------------------------------------------

8) Decision: Direct SGA Vote Administrators to Add SGA Delegates to SGA Voting Pages, Website and Email List (10 minutes)

*Sponsors*: Laura Wells (GROW), Mimi Newton (Bylaws)
*Proposal*: This proposal recommends that the Coordinating Committee direct the SGA Vote Administrators to add the SGA Delegates listed below for the Santa Cruz and Ventura Counties for the remaining 2016/2017 term, to the SGA Email List, the SGA Voting Pages and the GPCA Pages identifying SGA Delegates from the Counties by no later than 48 hours after the adoption of this proposal. In addition, the same CC direction applies to other active counties that submit SGA delegates for the 2016/2017 term, including counties in the process of certification such as Mendocino County, and others whose SGA delegation allotment is not currently filled:

1.  Santa Cruz County (3 delegates allotted.) - 3 delegates identified: Raven Playfaire, Zee (Rich) Zitola, and Thomas Leavitt. Santa Cruz is in bold ("active") on the list of Counties and their allotments; and

2.  Ventura County (3 delegates allotted.) - 3 delegates identified: Linda Moyer, Anthony Krzywicki, and Jewel Santana. Ventura County was certified as an active county on March 11 at the General Assembly in Bakersfield.  

*Background and Purpose*:

The following active counties have submitted the names and email addresses (to applications@cagreens.org) of SGA Delegates for the current term ending June 30, 2017, which have not been added to the GPCA website, voting SGA Delegates pages or email lists for the upcoming June 2017 SGA Votes as of the time of this proposal. In addition, other counties will likely submit SGA Delegates in the coming weeks.

1.  Santa Cruz County (3 delegates allotted.) - 3 delegates identified: Raven Playfaire, Zee (Rich) Zitola, and Thomas Leavitt. Santa Cruz is in bold ("active") on the list of Counties and their allotments. See email from Raven Playfaire to applications@cagreens.org below. 

2.  Ventura County (3 delegates allotted.) - 3 delegates identified: Linda Moyer, Anthony Krzywicki, and Jewel Santana. Ventura County was certified as an active county on March 11 at the General Assembly in Bakersfield. See email from Anthony Krzywicki to applications@cagreens.org below. 

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Upon adoption of this proposal by the Coordinating Committee, the SGA Vote Administrators are thereby directed to add the SGA Delegates for the Counties for the remaining 2016/2017 term, as identified above, to the SGA Email List, the SGA Voting Pages and the GPCA Pages identifying SGA Delegates from the Counties by no later than 48 hours after the adoption of this proposal.

GPCA Bylaw regarding Appointment of SGA Delegates:
7-6.1 Standing Delegates and Alternates
7-6.1(a) Delegates to the Standing Green Assembly shall be called Standing Delegates, shall be appointed by active County Organizations and shall serve for one year terms, with no term limits. Terms shall run concurrent with the GPCA's Fiscal Year.
7-6.1(b) Each active County Organization is entitled to as many Standing Delegates as it is entitled to General Assembly delegates under 7-1.2. The number of Standing Delegates per active County Organization shall be based upon the state of California's 154 Day Report of Registration in even-numbered years and its Odd-Numbered Year Report in odd-numbered years, and be calculated by the Coordinating Committee and published to the active County Organizations by the end of March, which shall form the basis for the number of delegates chosen by each active County Organization for the ensuing Fiscal Year.

A discussion was had during which it was confirmed that the Santa Cruz and Ventura SGA delegates have not received the SGA email messages, but noting that no emails have been going out since the original voting messages, so we don't really know who has been added to the email as of now.  Questions were raised about San Diego's GA Delegation and it was noted that San Diego did not have a quorum present at their most recent County Council meeting and have not added any additional delegates as a result.

Sanda requested that the language be changed to a request instead of directing the vote administrators to do anything because the way the Coordinating Committee communicates with its volunteers is demeaning.
 
Mimi declined to change the language to a request because of her repeated polite requests that have gone unanswered and because it is the Coordinating Committee that needs to be in control of which delegates are granted voting privileges according to the Bylaws, and it should not be a unilateral decision by the Vote Administrators.
 
Outstanding concerns – Sanda remains concerned that directing the vote administrators to take steps instead of asking them to do so is demeaning.  However, she is willing to stand aside.  [The following additional grounds for her concern were submitted by Sanda in response to the proposed draft minutes but were not recorded by the note taker during the call:  "No unilateral decisions are being made. Lack of activity has nothing to do with decisions being made. It is totally about the amount of time that volunteers are able to volunteer. This process was particularly hampered at this time because of the number of items and because counties often sent in information so late."]

There were no other outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

9) Decision Item: Ratification by Coordinating Committee of Voting Items Currently Under Discussion by the SGA (10 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton, Marin County
*Background and Purpose*:

Items 124 through 132 for initial discussion and, ultimately, voting by the GPCA Standing General Assembly were emailed to certain SGA Delegates by the Vote Administrators on Monday, May 8, 2017. Discussion periods for all items were identified as running from May 8, 2017 through June 18, 2017. Voting is scheduled to begin on the items on June 19, 2017 and end at midnight on June 25, 2017.

After the messages about the SGA Voting Items 124 through 132 were sent, there was some discussion on the SGA email list about certain errors that were either in the email messages themselves or reflected on the SGA voting pages, either on the voting pages or on the pages for bios and other information.

For example, one of the Co-Cos for the Platform Committee replied that, with respect to Item #130, the SGA Administrators were being requested to withdraw the item until "ERWG has commented on the version" that was sent to the Platform Committee and ERWG as directed by the Bakersfield GA. To date, it is not apparent that any steps have been taken to withdraw the item or even acknowledge the request by the SGA Administrators.

Other errors remain as well.

*Proposal*:

This proposal requests that, to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the upcoming GPCA SGA Voting, the Coordinating Committee ratify those SGA Items where voting has already been scheduled to begin on June 19, 2017 and end at midnight on June 25, 2017, in accordance with the following, and that the Coordinating Committee direct the SGA Vote Administrators to, by no later than within one week of the Coordinating Committee meeting: (1) send an email message to the SGA email list for every item where the original email message was inconsistent with the items as ratified by the Coordinating Committee correcting the inconsistent information; and (2) correct the SGA voting pages, including the candidate bio pages, for every item for which information on the SGA voting pages are currently inconsistent with the items as ratified by the Coordinating Committee.

This proposal also requests that the Coordinating Committee direct the SGA Vote Administrators to complete the corrections to the SGA Voting Pages and the email messages to ensure consistency with the CC's ratification of these items as soon as possible, but by no later than Monday, June 12, 2017.

It is proposed that the Coordinating Committee ratify the following SGA Voting Items:

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: If adopted, the SGA Vote Administrators would thereby be directed to complete the corrections to the SGA Voting Pages and the email messages to ensure consistency with the CC's ratification of these items as soon as possible, but by no later than Monday, June 12, 2017.
*References*: http://sga.cagreens.org/vote/index

There was a discussion about whether Doug Barnett had applied to the CC or just the GPUS Delegation.  Both Bert and Sanda said they would look to see if Doug had applied to the CC by the deadline.  If he has, an amendment was offered to include his name on the male CC candidates list above.  However, if Doug did not file an application by the deadline, the list above would remain as is.

We also discussed that Rich (Zee) Zitola of Santa Cruz had submitted an application for the GPUS Delegation and that Zee had concerns that the deadline had been changed from previous years and that this had not been made clear to potential applicants.  It was noted that the application deadline was changed about four years ago and that Zee has participated in two elections since that time and would have received three recent emails with the correct dates and directions, plus being on calls where it was discussed. 

Sanda noted, with respect to item #130, that she "discussed Shane's request for a withdrawal with him."

Any outstanding concerns – 
 
A concern was raised about Zee Zitola’s application being late.  However, since Zee's name is not on the list of GPUS Delegates to be confirmed by the CC in this action, this concern was resolved.

No other outstanding questions or concerns; The foregoing items are approved by consensus with the caveat that, if Sanda or Bert discover a timely email application from Doug Barnett for the CC, he will be added to the list of male CC candidates.  [Note: Sanda DID submit Doug's timely email application to the CC after the meeting was adjourned, so Doug should be added to the list of male CC candidates.]
 
Bert to implement this item by communicating with the Vote Administrators.

10) Decision Item: Direction to SGA Vote Administrators to Remove Candidates' Photos from SGA Voting Pages (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Mimi Newton
*Proposal*: The Coordinating Committee direct the SGA Vote Administrators to remove the photographs of candidates for the CC, the GPUS Delegation and candidates for Alternate Delegate positions from the GPCA SGA Voting Website's candidate biography pages.   Providing this direction to the SGA Voting Administrators will demonstrate that the GPCA Coordinating Committee is not insensitive to the historical and current oppression of women in our society by being judged on their appearance in ways that men in our society are not.   It will also demonstrate that the Coordinating Committee is not deaf to the voices of the Green Party women who objected to the photographs being posted a year ago.   Specific direction should be provided to the SGA Vote Administrators regarding the removal of these and any other candidate photographs unless and until a specific policy is adopted by the Coordinating Committee, the SGA or the General Assembly endorsing or directing the posting of such photographs with candidate biographies.   The direction should include a deadline of no later than June 12, 2017 for removal of the photographs.
*Background and Purpose*:

Candidates' photos have appeared on the biographies of some of the candidates currently in the running for positions on the GPCA Coordinating Committee, the GPUS Delegation and Alternate positions on the GPUS Delegation.

The email message that sought applications from candidates for these positions did not mention including photographs nor was this question raised with the CC in advance of the biographies and photos being posted on the SGA Voting pages.   (See Appendix A.)

However, the question of candidate biographies including photos had been raised as an issue in the most recent CC candidate elections.   During the 2016 CC elections, photos on the bios of many of the women CC candidates had appeared without explanation.   At some point during the SGA discussion period, it was suggested that photos had appeared as the result of a last-minute decision by the SGA Vote Administrators.   Many of the comments raised during this discussion period  - including female CC Candidates at the time -- pointed out the  'sexist atmosphere'  that resulted from both the way in which photos were posted and the fact that they were posted at all.

In May of this year, I requested that the SGA Voting Administrators remove the photos from the bios pages, repeating some of the concerns that were raised over this very issue by Green Party women last year.   (See Appendix B.)   In essence, the explanation from the SGA Vote Administrator in reply to my request was that, in the absence of a policy against posting photos from candidates who had submitted them, the SGA Vote Administrators felt the photos should be posted.   (See Appendix C.)

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Upon adoption of this proposal by the Coordinating Committee, the SGA Vote Administrators are thereby directed to remove any and all candidate photographs from the GPCA SGA Voting Website Biographies Pages, including for the upcoming Male and Female Coordinating Committee Elections, GPUS Delegate Election and GPUS Alternate Delegate Election.   The SGA Vote Administrators are directed to remove all such candidate photographs from the SGA Voting candidate biographies as soon as possible but in no event later than June 12, 2017.   The SGA Vote Administrators are further directed not to include photographs with SGA Voting biographies unless and until a specific policy is adopted by the Coordinating Committee, the SGA or the General Assembly endorsing or directing the posting of such photographs with candidate biographies.

------------------------------------------

11B) Decision: Modify procedure for CC Meeting Attendance (5 min) (picked up again after 11C)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks
*Background and Purpose*: Frequently it has been unclear when some Coordinating Committee members have joined committee conference calls, and some members have appeared to have attended only a small portion of a given conference call.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: This item will be implemented beginning on the next meeting of the Coordinating Committee following its June 5, 2017 conference call meeting, and this decision will be noted in the agenda announcement for the July 3, 2017 conference call meeting, and will be recorded by a CC co-coordinator or their designee into the GPCA Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures - Article III Meetings.

*Proposal*: To establish GPCA CC rules and procedures which require that each GPCA Coordinating Committee member who attends a CC meeting must be present for the majority of a meeting to be considered an attendee of the meeting, and must have announced their presence at the meeting immediately upon joining the meeting so that it is clear at what time they joined the meeting and it has been established that they have heard the full discussion around any decision item on which they are voting.

The item will be codified by replacing the following text in GPCA Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures - Article III Meetings:

Section 3-5 Quorum

Quorum for CC meetings shall be a simple majority of seated members, according to the proposal passed by the General Assembly in October 2009 (http://www.cagreens.org/plenary/archives/agendas/0910proposals.pdf).

with the following replacement text:

Section 3-5 Quorum &amp; Attendance

3-5.1 Quorum for CC meetings shall be a simple majority of seated members, according to the proposal passed by the General Assembly in October 2009 (http://www.cagreens.org/plenary/archives/agendas/0910proposals.pdf).
3-5.2 CC members shall not be considered to have attended a CC meeting unless they are present for a length of time equal to or greater than one half of the scheduled meeting time, and they have clearly announced themselves as present at the beginning of that span of time. A CC member who has arrived so late to a CC meeting that they are unable to attend at least one half of the meeting, shall not be counted as in attendance, or toward quorum for that meeting, and shall not be permitted to vote on decision items.
3-5.3 CC members shall not be permitted to count toward quorum or to vote on an item on a CC meeting agenda if they did not announce themselves as present at the meeting prior to the item being presented and discussed.
3-5.4 On any vote taken on any CC meeting agenda item, if a CC member voting on that item was not present for at least half of the meeting as required in 3-5.2, their vote on that item shall be rendered invalid, and that member’s presence does not count toward quorum for the purposes of voting on that item.
3-5.5 The minutes taker for a CC meeting shall record the time of the meeting at which role has been taken and quorum established, and shall also clearly record the time of arrival of any CC member who announces their presence late at the meeting after role has been taken and quorum has been established. The minutes taker shall note if and when a member arriving late has arrived in the midst of the presentation and discussion on a decision item.
3-5.6 A quorum of the CC may, during a CC meeting, waive any one or all of the requirements under sections 3-5.2 through 3-5.5 of this article for any CC member present at that meeting, by a 60% majority vote.

GPCA Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures - Article III Meetings: http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/procedures#Article_III:_Meetings

There was a discussion about people who do not identify themselves or get on and off the call without announcing themselves, the fact that the Co-Cos get a print out of who is on the call and that there is a way to review that during the call, a question was raised about what happens if the call ends early, after somebody who voted on it got off the call - how would they know they didn't stay on long enough.  Other concerns with implementation as written were raised.  

Eric responded that he had considered the issue but could not think of a good way to resolve that issue and created the waiver in the last provision to allow for these kinds of situations.  
 
Outstanding concern: Sanda Everette – feels the proposal is mean spirited and doesn’t trust our volunteers.  She acknowledges that people have gamed the system in the past, and, specifically, that the Steering Committee, with Jill, at the GP-US level, have gamed the system. But, she is not aware of anyone ever having done that in California and encouraged us to be more trusting.  
 
Outstanding concern:  Mike Goldbeck – concerned that this proposal limits the vote of CC members unnecessarily – if they come in and vote even if they’ve done their homework –it demands their attendance during the majority of the meeting.  The waiver language does not resolve this but constitutes governing by tyranny so that you can waive it when it suits the majority.
 
Sanda and Mike G are not willing to stand aside.

The item went to a vote: 

Vic – yes
June – yes
Eric – yes
Susan -- no
Sanda -- no
Mike G. -- no
Bert -- yes
Tarik -- abstain
Mike M. -- no
Mimi -- yes
Laura -- yes
Steven -- yes
 
7 yes votes, 4 no votes, and 1 abstention.  The item passes with 7 out of 11 of the yes and no votes cast.  

Bert will take the lead in seeing that we add these revisions to the CC internal procedures.

12) Decision: Follow Up To Implement GPCA Decision To Oppose SB 775 (Wiekowski - Cap &amp; Trade) (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks
*Proposal*: Place on the June 17-18, 2017 GPCA General Assembly Agenda a decision item for Ratification of the Coordinating Committee’s Friday May 26 decision, that the GPCA opposes SB 775 (Wiekowski – Cap &amp; Trade Extension), and take any other decisions needed to implement and publicize the GPCA’s opposition to SB 775.
*Background and Purpose*: On Friday, May 26, 2pm the GPCA completed a 48 hour emergency online vote to oppose SB 775, a state bill that would extend and entrench California’s failed ‘Cap &amp; Trade’ regulatory response to the global climate crisis. Though both the Green Party of the United States and Green Party of California have released statements opposing various carbon emission trading schemes as a bad methodology for addressing the climate crisis, the GPCA does not have express platform policies opposing carbon emissions trading. Therefore, the GPCA CC’s vote to oppose SB 775 should be agendized for the June 17-18, 2017 General Assembly for ratification. The GPCA CC should also take this decision item as an opportunity to approve any further logistical steps deemed necessary to implementing and publicizing the GPCA CC’s decision to oppose SB 775.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Within 24 hours of passage, the GPCA Co-Coordinators should contact the June 2017 General Assembly Agenda Committee to ensure that this item is added to the GA agenda, and GPCA CC members should initiate any other actions approved as part of this decision item.

13) Decision: Accessibility of GPCA Archive of General Assemblies (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Victoria Ashley
*Proposal*: Direct the IT Committee to create a plan to fix the page so that documents which are no longer available are no longer listed as available, and documents which require a password will query a user for a password, and provide information on how to obtain a password and who to contact, if the member does not already have a password.

*Background and Purpose*: Currently, a large collection of GPCA archive records of past General Assemblies - the central decision-making events of our state party - appear in a list on the GPCA website, but many are not available for members to access and read (http://www.cagreens.org/ga/archive).  It is unclear why these records are not available and how they can be fixed to be made appropriately available and useful to GPCA members.

While a great deal of work has gone into creating and maintaining the archive, its use is limited when members cannot access it.Â Additionally, having "page-not-found" responses to document requests creates confusion for new Greens and frustration for others seeking information.

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: None

No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.


------------------------------------------

14) Decision: Accessibility of Finance Committee Documents on GPCA Website (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Victoria Ashley (5 minutes)
*Proposal*: Direct IT Committee to provide access to any internal financial documents on the Finance Committee page to the Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang (currently Assistant Treasurer with bank account access).
*Background and Purpose*: Currently, the website appears to provide access to a cache of financial documents on the Finance Committee webpage (http://www.cagreens.org/committees/finance)Â with the statement: "Internal Committee documents, password required."  However, no dialog or prompt appears in which to enter a password (http://www.cagreens.org/finance/internal). It would be helpful to have access to archival financial documents as our new Treasurer, Ruscal Cayangyang, starts his term.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Preferably before July 2017


No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

------------------------------------------

15) Decision item: Support SB562 (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Mike Murphy
*Background and Purpose*:  The San Francisco Green Party has added its name to the list of endorsers of SB562. County Council Member, Barry Hermanson drafted the attached letter which is an accurate description of the proposed legislation.
*Proposal*: GPCA should take a position supporting SB562 and direct the Media Committee to immediately send out a press release stating the GPCA's position and a letter of support to Senator Ricardo Lara.
*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: Immediate decision item. Empower Media Committee member (to be determined) to immediately draft and send press release and correspondence.
*References*: Bill Text - SB-562 The Healthy California Act. (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562)

16) Decision: GPCA Opposition Of California Bills &amp; Ballot Measures Attacking Community Choice &amp; Other Renewable Energy Programs (5 minutes)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks
*Background*
US web assets (5 min)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks

Especially Since 2010, and even beforehand, the monopoly electrical utilities PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E and SCE, and their house trade unions, often in collusion with the nonprofit organization TURN (The Utility Reform Network : which is ostensibly a consumer watchdog of the monopoly utilities) have sponsored and supported repeated local and state level legislation and ballot measures that attack and seek to undermine, and even eliminate, Community Choice programs and other local community based, not-for-profit clean energy alternatives to the monopoly utilities. In recent years, because of new state laws preventing the monopoly utilities from directly advertising against Community Choice, these attacks have nearly all been sponsored and supported jointly by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1245, the California State Association of Electrical Workers, the Coalition of California Utility Employees, and/or The Utility Reform Network; usually under the direction of electrical trade lobbyists Scott Wetch and/or Hunter Stern : sometimes with the open support of one or more of the monopoly utilities.

Often such bills and ballot measures run very rapidly through the governmental process, making the gathering of opposition positions and statements against the measures very time sensitive. For that reason I am proposing that the GPCA Coordinating Committee adopt a default position opposing any bill or ballot measure sponsored by these entities, unless and until the Community Choice advocacy community is clearly also in support of the bill or ballot measure.

*Proposal*

The GPCA Coordinating Committee resolves that the GPCA is in opposition to any state or local legislation or ballot measure regarding electricity which is supported and/or sponsored by any of the California monopoly electrical utilities (also known as investor owned utilities - IOUs) and/or any of the electrical worker associations or unions of the California monopoly electrical utilities (or their agents), including any such legislation or ballot measure also supported or sponsored by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), unless and until Community Choice energy advocates are clearly also in support of the legislation or ballot measure.

*Effective Date* Immediately On Passage: Should also be presented at next GPCA General Assembly to ensure that the GA concurs with the decision.

17) Decision: Call on GPUS to stop infiltration of GPUS web assets (5 mins.)

*Sponsor*: Eric Brooks

*Proposal*: [Resolution - Full Text] The Green Party of California calls on the Green Party of the United States to condemn and halt racism &amp; gender phobia on FaceBook groups and other pages headed by the Green Party name, and calls on the Green Party of the United States to file a complaint with FaceBook stating that the FaceBook group “Green Party of the United States Issues &amp; Discussion Group” has become unaffiliated with, and unrepresentative of, The Green Party of the United States, and should therefore not be allowed to continue under any name that suggests affiliation with the Green Party of the United States .

*Background and Purpose*:

Many of you are likely aware of the FaceBook group named  "Green Party of the United States Issues &amp; Discussion Group."

This FaceBook group page has been going for many years and was begun as an officially sanctioned group page of the Green Party. However it has frequently had strong public conflicts over issues, and that eventually led to the following disclaimer being posted on the group page:

"The Green Party Issues &amp; Discussion Group is your place to explore the political field of the Green Party. Although not officially affiliated with the Green Party of the United State page we exist to promote the Green Party and allow more content and dialog. While we would hope to keep to the ideals, key values, and mission statement of the Green Party, opinions expressed in the group are of individual members and should be taken as such. Those words don't represent the Green Party officially as a political entity."

(This disclaimer is contradictory and not credible appearing under the group name Green Party of the United States Issues &amp; Discussion Group, and the group clearly remains fully identified by name as a Green Party of the United States site. FaceBook group users often do not even read pinned comments with such disclaimers.)

Since the disclaimer was posted, posts by non-Greens outright attacking the Green Party on the group page have become all too frequent and have often been allowed to remain posted. Many group members have been concerned about this but have not yet taken action. And many members have left the group entirely.

However, more recently, deeply troubling posts have repeatedly gone up and have been allowed to remain on the group page, which are using dog whistle racist arguments to state that Affirmative Action and other laws and policies specifically protecting people of color are ‘racist’ because they protect or ‘treat differently’ specific groups of people. Similar posts have hyperbolically demonized discussions of white privilege as ‘racist’. Other posts have been transphobic and promoted gender discrimination, and have been allowed to remain posted.

Over the past few months, a wave of attacks on, and targeted reporting of, posters on the group bringing up issues of white privilege and trans-gender identity has resulted in the voluntary exit (and at times even the forced removal) of Greens of color, and Greens of gender diversity, from the group.

Here is one example of a twice repeated dog whistle post attacking affirmative action, that has been allowed to remain on the page (with one group admin stating that she does not see the post as racist), and which began:

"Danny Pugatsky created a poll. Having different sets of rules for different people, based solely on their race, is racism. True or False"

You can see that full post, and similar posts, at the following links:

18) Decision: Oppose Jordon Cove LNG Export Station (5 minutes)


*Sponsor*: June Brashares (for Humboldt County)
*Purpose and Background*: Humboldt County asked that this be put on the CC agenda. It is for the GPCA to take a statewide position following the Green Party of Humboldt County expressing opposition to a proposed LNG export terminal and associated gas pipeline, and fracking in Oregon and Northern California.
*Proposal*: GPCA pass a resolution to oppose Jordan Cove LNG Export Terminal and Pipeline.

The resolution is:

Green Party of California Resolution to Oppose Jordan Cove LNG Export Terminal and Pipeline

WHEREAS, there is currently a proposed build of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Coos Bay, Oregon and a 230 mile pacific connector pipeline by Jordan Cove LNG and their parent company Veresen out of Canada;

WHEREAS, use of LNG results in methane emissions. Methane traps heat in the atmosphere at a rate 86 times greater than Carbon Dioxide;

WHEREAS, these projects will increase the amount of exported fossil fuel to the Asian markets from the United States and Canada, thus increasing our commitment to fossil fuel energy for decades and perpetuating the production of non-renewable energy at the expense of developing &amp; investing in local renewable energy sources;

WHEREAS, the proposed project would conflict with efforts to promote increased use of renewable energy;

WHEREAS, the Green Party is recognized as an international leader among governments in supporting the reduction of greenhouse gases, combating global warming and investing in renewable energy;

WHEREAS, the Green Party of California's reputation as environmental leaders in sustainability would be adversely impacted by the approval of the proposed LNG and pipeline projects;

WHEREAS, the proposed pipelines would cross hundreds streams, rivers and wetlands. This represents a major threat to riparian habitats critical for threatened fish, songbirds, amphibians and many other species in Northern California and Southern Oregon;

WHERE AS, a pipeline placed underneath Native American watersheds such as the Klamath River, Rogue River and Coos Bay would conflict with the efforts of the indigenous Tribes of Northern California and Southern Oregon  who have been working to recover and protect these resources. These Tribes include the Yurok, Hoopa, Karuk, Modoc and Klamath;

WHERE AS, less than 1/3 of the 3,500 temporary jobs associated with the construction of the pipeline will be given to citizens of California or Oregon and none of the projected 200 permanent jobs are required to be given to citizens of California or Oregon;

WHERE AS, Veresen the Canadian parent company of Jordan Cove LNG stands to make the majority of profit from the export station and pipeline. Secondary profit holders come from Companies based out of Texas that produce fracked gas in Utah, Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California;

WHERE AS, rejection of the Jordan Cove LNG Export Terminal would halt the export of fracked gas out of Canada, Wisconsin, Utah, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California, protecting the vital water ways of California and Oregon and decreasing the production of fracked gas throughout the country;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Green Party of California expresses its opposition to the proposed Jordan Cove LNG terminal and associated pipeline; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Green Party of California encourages the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), California Governor Jerry Brown, Oregon Governor Kate Brown and the agencies of their State Governments to do everything in their power not to allow the proposed Jordan Cove LNG terminal and pipeline in Northern California and Southern Oregon.

*Implementation/Timeline/Resources*: CC to approve resolution May 1, 2017; Effective immediately; GPCA Media Committee and all entities of the GPCA, including Counties are requested to whatever extent they are able to please publicize that GPCA has passed the Resolution, publicize on websites, via Facebook, press release, etc...
*References*: There were some background papers attached to the original request.  Unfortunately those cannot be attached to this email.  Contact June directly for details.

There was a discussion about whether whatever we do would need to be ratified by the GA.  It was pointed out that Single Payer Health Care is already part of the platform and doesn't need action by the GA.  A suggestion was made that the Media Committee could make an announcement about the CC's action on this item as well as the previous ones that were just discussed.  A question was raised about putting this to an online vote but June wants to at least test for consensus before she agrees to that.  
No outstanding questions or concerns; approved by consensus.

--------
A brief discussion about a CC meeting on Friday evening before the GA was had but we agreed to discuss it further online. Twinkles.
 
------------------------------------------
19) Adjournment at 9:30 pm.

Results of Vote to Oppose the SB 775 Cap &amp; Trade bill

*Voting Text*

Timeline: 2pm, Wednesday, May 24, through 2pm, Friday, May 26
Quorum: 2/3 of 19 members = 13
Approval Threshold: 80% of those voting yes or no

Coordinating Committee Members, please vote ‘Yes’ to support the following proposal, or ‘No’ to reject the proposal, in a reply to this email, by Friday May 26 at 2pm.

Proposal Text: The Green Party of California opposes SB 775 (Wiekowski-De Leon) which would extend the failed ‘Cap and Trade’ greenhouse gas emissions market trading system in California, would enable unlimited carbon allowances, and also allow free carbon allowances. The GPCA endorses the Food &amp; Water Watch opposition letter to SB 775 (see attached).

Need for Emergency Vote: The Sponsors of SB 775 intend to complete its passage by June 15, 2017. For the Green Party of California to have its voice heard on this bill, it must take the earliest possible action in order to be listed as an opponent to the bill before it enters further hearings and votes in the California Senate and Assembly. The sooner that the GPCA weighs in on the bill, the more effective our impact will be in opposing it.

Background &amp; Purpose:

In the late 1990s the Clinton administration, during Kyoto Protocol negotiations, created the tactic of adopting ‘Carbon Trading’ ostensibly as a ‘market based solution’ to the climate crisis, but with the actual intention of undermining any strong limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the Kyoto Protocol. The Clinton administration was successful and ‘carbon trading’ was adopted as the core mechanism of the Protocol, with the Protocol setting extremely low concrete limits on greenhouse gas emissions, instead favoring a capitalist market based ‘Cap and Trade’ system. Since the introduction of the Cap and Trade strategy, Europe has gone through decades of repeated Cap and Trade failures. Cap and Trade rules and mechanisms are easily gamed by corporate influence and have never succeeded in Europe, where emissions have consistently risen higher under various carbon trading schemes and ‘reforms’. The successful derailing of climate crisis policy into the illusion of market based carbon trading has resulted in decades of inaction on real climate solutions. Only the recent construction and installation of actual renewable energy generation and efficiency measures have been successful at reducing emissions.

Recently California adopted a Cap and Trade system, which has likewise failed. The California Cap and Trade program has held two carbon credit auctions which performed so badly that the program must now either be closed down or redesigned and extended. California’s Cap and Trade system is also riddled with bad climate policy. For example it allows timber companies to receive carbon reduction credits when they clearcut forests and replace them with tree plantations (thereby causing massive greenhouse gas emissions and losses of carbon storage in mature forests).

SB 775 is an attempt to redesign and revive the California Cap and Trade system, in the guise of ‘reform’. SB 775 uses the fig leaf of getting rid of the carbon offsets in the Cap and Trade system to masquerade as credible reform, while it contrarily has language that allows polluting corporations unlimited and free carbon emission allowances.

1: Abstain

Both quorum and the 80% threshold were met and so the item passes.

Statement of Adam Siegel

I'd like to put my name forward for appointment to the GPCA Bylaws Committee. I currently serve as secretary on the Yolo County county council. I was a delegate to the recent GPCA Assembly in Bakersfield.  I've been working in bylaws-defined governance here in California for many years, and have contributed or authored a number of significant bylaws revisions for several of the organizations of which I am a member.  As a librarian at the University of California, I belong to an association (Librarians Association the University of California, or LAUC) with UC-wide and local bylaws, both sets of which I have revised (including bringing local bylaws into compliance with statewide bylaws).  As a member of the American Federation of Teachers, I have also revised our local bylaws.  I am currently drafting revisions for the UC-AFT (statewide) union to which I belong.  Bylaws revisions I've drafted, charged, or reviewed include membership definition, committee sizes and charges, officer duties, board functions, and procedural issues.  Since helping reactivate the Yolo County council, I have been drafting revisions to our local bylaws, which should (we hope) clarify and simplify county council roles, responsibilities, procedures, and activities.

May 21, 2017 - Mendocino County Green Party Meeting Minutes

Mendocino Greens Present:
Ike Heinz, Steven Day, Margaret Koster, Cynthia Raiser Jeavons, Shonduel, Sheila Dawn Tracy, Pam Brown, Ron Lippert, Scott Menzies

Carrie Durkee, Mendocino Co. visitor
Alex Harter, Mendocino County resident with plans to re-register Green immediately

Green Guests from Humboldt and Butte Counties:
David Cobb, Kelsey Reedy, Matt Smith-Caggiano, Erik Rydberg

Introductions: Each person stated name and town

David Cobb presented a brief history of the Green Party internationally and in the U.S.

The 4 pillars of Green values, shared worldwide, are Ecology (everything is interconnected), Grassroots Democracy (decentralized participation in political decision-making), Social Justice (includes racial justice in U.S.), and Non Violence (rejection of violence as an affirmative political tool).

Electoral victories more difficult in U.S. due to winner take all system.  Social movement or political party?  Electorally run candidates, have program and platform.

Big Picture and Current Moment.  We are in ecological, economic and political crisis.  Capitalism morphing to fascism if the process is not interrupted.  Heading for multisystem collapse, the system cannot govern itself.  Green  Party in a position to influence what comes next.

Discussion:

Obsevations from most recent General Assembly in Bakersfield. Many new people, many young people and lots of ethnic diversity, many women participating.  Problems with mechanistic operation of state party, bylaws amended in Bakerfield to make new counties activating easier.  Energy to improve operation of state party coming from new folks joining up.

Many people now more politically aware and wanting to be active. Rejection of progressives by Democrats.  Need to gear up to welcome those looking for a place to go.  Need professionalism, vision and a presentation for people to attach to.

Myths about Greens, "they can’t make headway"
Indigenous roots of Green Party in New Zealand relates to Standing Rock in this country.

Green Party is the only global party

What is the point if your vote doesn’t count?

2 party winner take all system is a big part of the problem hampering Greens getting ahead.  Alternative political parties play a valuable role in the U.S.  Actual change requires a movement with an electoral arm.  Historically 3rd party causes have included the abolition of slavery, women’s vote, the 8 hr. day, end of child labor, etc.

Local races and issues are where we can have effect.

Occupy is non partisan.

Major parties are inflexible.

Scott ran for Ft. Bragg City Council, was not elected and found the process disheartening, especially in a small town where other relationships are affected.  He feels one of our major local problems is that discourse tends to be anger dominated and not strategic.  We have to reign in our crazy to get to serious radical change.  Its hard to get progressive Dems to recognize that they are really Green.

Visionaries have to out organize kooks.

Register with the party that reflects your conscience.

Need to be inclusive.  Objection to labeling people kooks.

Difference between party and movement.

Our job is education and growing the party.  Need to do outreach. The Democratic Party is not working, we need to build the plan for people to exit to the Green Party.

Becoming a certified county Green Party:

Review of duties of positions, need to revise Mendocino County Bylaws,  opportunity to participate with voting delegates at General Assembly and Standing General Assembly.  The following people volunteered for the following positions and were selected by consensus:

County Council:
L. Steven Day, Leggett, lsteven.day@gmail.com, 707-272-1323
Cynthia Raiser Jeavons,  Willits, cynthia2@sonic.net, 650-888-9781

Ron Lippert, Willits, norwal13@yahoo.com, 707-513-7620
Alex Harter, Willits, lxharter@yahoo.com, 310-739-5524

Motion Made and Passed:

Cynthia moved to amend Mendocino County Bylaws to change number of persons on County Council from 7 to 5.  Adopted by consensus.

Sheila Dawn reported there is money left in checking account from prior years.  Moved and adopted to pay GA fees for delegates with funds from this account.

From: Jared Laiti <jared.laiti>
Date: June 4, 2017 at 7:23:35 PM PDT

I'm willing to continue as SOS Liaison - but I would also understand if the CC wanted to nominate someone else. I have a job where I really am not available to respond to GP business during the work day, which at times has included very short notice of deadlines from the SOS (not too bad really this last cycle but in the past more so). So I'd understand if GPCA wanted someone more available to respond on a same business day basis. So far, there has never been a missed deadline, but there is the potential. Also, I've always taken a pretty narrow view of the role of the liaison, because I see it as basically an administrative position of passing along info between the party and the SOS and counties. So I'm willing to continue with these understandings.

Thanks,
Jared

- April 2017 Minutes of Santa Cruz Green Assembly, transmitted by Raven Playfaire: (see below)
- May 2017 Minutes of Santa Cruz Green Assembly, transmitted by Raven Playfaire: (see below)
- Draft Minutes from the GPCA General Assembly, March 2017, Decision to Certify Santa Cruz County on Saturday at 1:05 pm: http://cagreens.org/ga/2017-03/minutes


Santa Cruz Green Assembly Minutes, April 2017:

We had our monthly meeting (in a long time) on April 26th and we got some good strategizing done.

1) The three sitting Santa Cruz GA/county council members, Raven Playfaire Rich Zitola and Thomas Leavitt discussed whether or not they should be designated the SGA members for the upcoming year of 2017/18, as they had been acting as such for the year 2016/17. This seemed the best option rather than try to find newer local members.

2) The three of us attended the Statewide GA in March in Bakersfield and we will also attend the upcoming GA in June in Sacramento. We discussed issues that we wanted to officially endorse, like Move To Amend, Single Payer Healthcare and an end to the current wars. These were no-brainers and it was just a matter of making it official.

a) We also talked about what we wanted to endorse locally.
First and foremost in that department was repealing the city councils ban on sleeping anywhere in the city limits in public. We agree that this is nothing short of inhuman! We endorse repealing it and any and all efforts to create affordable housing ASAP!

b) We discussed the widening of Highway 1 but did not come to consensus on that. However we did agree that we should endorse funding for alternative forms of transportation including increasing funding for the metro center and buses, more/improved bike paths and possibly trains.

c) Talked about the Beach Flats Community Garden situation and decided we needed to find out where that situation stood.

d) We discussed resurrecting the Civilian Police Review Board and learning more about what happened with the ICE raids. We are definitely interested in making sure there is no local funding going to police raids for ICE, Medical Marijuana or The Bear Cat etc.

e) We officially endorsed the Climate Change March on Saturday April 29th and The May Day March.

f) We also officially endorsed Calexit. If it comes to Fruition that California gets enough signatures to get an initiative on the ballot, we would definitely support it!

g) We discussed getting involved with local groups like Indivisible, Our Revolution and Resist!

3) I planned to do some tabling.

4) I have been part of the GROW (grass roots organizing working group) team on the state level for the last couple of months. They have been putting together a packet for new counties to get started. I had hoped that Santa Cruz County could work together with Monterey and Santa Clara to reactivate San Benito and/or San Luis Obispo. But we decided at the meeting that for the time being we need to concentrate on just getting Santa Cruz county reactivated fully and will leave such efforts to Monterey and Santa Clara if they choose to take it up. We just don't have the manpower yet.

5) We also discussed what to do if people wanted to run for office locally or at the state and national levels. It was apparent that we should just refer them to Rich as he has the most experience with running candidates and campaigns.


Santa Cruz Green Assembly Minutes May 2017

Agenda items for 5/31/17:

1. Homeless Coalition

2. GROW Report

3. Approval of April Minutes and May minutes.

1. Thomas is going to be the Liaison to a new(ish) group here in Santa Cruz that is working on Homelessness issues such as how to help homeless people with getting laundry done, storage lockers, repealing the sleeping ban (an inhumane local ordinance instituted within the last year or two) and other similar issues. He'll report back to our county GA with ideas of what we can do locally as a political party.

2. Raven reported issues discussed on the GROW call last week, including state website updates and changing the monthly GROW call to the second Tuesday of each month.

3. Thomas and Rich let Raven know that they would approve the minutes as transcribed by Raven for both April and May without an additional meeting in June. We decided unanimously that no emergency meeting was warranted in June and that we would meet on our regularly scheduled meeting on the fourth Wednesday, June 28th at 7 p.m. at the Saturn Cafe. Raven agreed to get a newsletter and minutes out by the end of today (June 1st) to Mike Feinstein for the Nationbuilder database
