<p><b>Article 1 Authority</b></p>
<p><b>1-1</b> In May 2003, the Green Party of California (GPCA) General Assembly delegated responsibility implementing and revising the Personnel Policy to the Coordinating Committee. The Coordinating Committee has since delegated responsibility for implementing the Personnel Policy to the Personnel Committee, while retaining the authority to amend the Personnel Policy with the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p><b>1-2</b> Amendments to the Personnel Policy shall be made by the Coordinating Committee. The Personnel Committee shall be primarily responsible for recommending amendments to the Personnel Policy, but other Coordinating Committee members may also initiate amendments.</p>
<p><b>Article II Objectives</b></p>
<p>The Personnel Policy exists to codify the relationship between the GPCA and its independent contractors and employees, and provide all involved with a written record of policies and expectations. Each independent contractor and employee shall be given a physical copy of this policy and be informed of any change in policy.</p>
<p><b>Article III Personnel Committee</b></p>
<p><b>3-1</b> The Personnel Committee is a sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee, charged with implementing the GPCA Personnel Policy and with proposing amendments to the Personnel Policy.</p>
<p><b>3-2</b> The Personnel Committee shall be composed of six members appointed by the Coordinating Committee, each serving two year terms, with three members appointed annually and with appointments to occur in January of each year.</p>
<p><b>Article IV Eligibility </b></p>
<p><b>4-1 Party Membership</b></p>
<p>Membership of GPCA shall be made a condition of employment as an independent contractor and/or as an employee, except where the GPCA is already protected by attorney-client privilege and/or accountant-client privilege, in which case GPCA membership shall not be a condition of employment, or in the case where the GPCA is contracting for logistical or food services for an event.</p>
<p><b>4-2 Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<p>No person may apply for a position who is, or has been within the three prior months, a member of the Personnel Committee. When a committee or working group member applies for a position that will be supervised by that committee, that member may not participate in the committee's decision-making process, including any consensus-seeking, voting or participating in the committee's discussion of the hire; nor may they participate in any of the committee's management of the position once hired, unless as requested by the committee as part its regular evaluation process as defined in this Personnel Policy. No employee will be selected for a position in which a relative (by blood, adoption, marriage, or legal partnership) has supervisory or direct administrative authority over her or him.</p>
<p><b>Article V Job Announcement/Notification/Applications</b></p>
<p><b>5-1</b> Once funds are allocated for an independent contractor or employee in the GPCA's annual budget, the Committee or Working Group from whose budget line the funds are allocated, shall prepare a draft job description and project description, for review and approval by the Personnel Committee. Job descriptions will be approved for all positions prior to hiring.</p>
<p><b>5-2</b> Once a job description is available, notices of available job positions shall be made broadly available on the GPCA's web site, email lists, social media outlets and other venues, and with consideration to the GPCA's affirmative action policy. Each job announcement shall include a description of the position offered, its key responsibilities and specific tasks, and its qualifications and pay; and a clear place to send the application.</p>
<p><b>5-3</b> Job applications shall include a summary of experience and other qualifications, samples of relevant previous work product and three references. All references shall be verified by the Committee or Working Group, and if the employee is hired, become part of the employee's permanent record.</p>
<p><b>5-4</b> Each applicant shall demonstrate familiarity with with the GPCA's platform, Ten Key Values and positions on public policy; its candidates, campaigns and officeholders; and its general means of operation.</p>
<p><b>Article VI Hiring</b></p>
<p><b>6-1</b> The Committee or Working Group shall review all applications and determine what follow up actions, including interviews, are necessary to conduct to make its recommendations.  The Committee or Working Group shall base its recommendations upon the applicant's resume/application, skills and abilities, history, interviews and ability to perform the work within the budgeted amount, as well as upon the general body of the GPCA's platform, policies and practices. The Committee or Working Group shall submit its hiring recommendations and draft contract to the Personnel Committee for approval. </p>
<p><b>6-2</b> The Personnel Committee shall make the final decision on hiring, in keeping with the procedures provided for in the Personnel Policy. All applicable national, state and local laws shall be followed in hiring and employment.</p>
<p><b>6-3</b> The Personnel Committee shall base its decisions upon the recommendation of the Committee and Working Group, the applicant's resume/application, history and upon the general body of the GPCA's platform, policies and practices. The Committee or Working Group may appeal the decision of the Personnel Committee regarding the project description, job description and/or hire to the Coordinating Committee. It shall require a 2/3 vote of the Coordinating Committee to overturn the decision of the Personnel Committee.</p>
<p><b>6-4</b> The GPCA is committed to equality of opportunity for all employees and job applicants. The GPCA will not discriminate against employees or job applicants because of race, color, national origin, age, religion, union affiliation, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, or any factor unrelated to the job requirements. We are committed to employing a gender-balanced, diverse work force, and taking the necessary steps in hiring to achieve that goal. We will comply fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p><b>6-5</b> Once a decision is made by the Personnel Committee, the recommending Committee or Working Group shall notify all applicants in writing of the results.</p>
<p><b>Article VII Supervision and Evaluation</b></p>
<p><b>Section 7-1 Supervision</b></p>
<p>Independent Contractors and Employees are supervised by the committee or working group from whose budget line they are retained. Communication should be sufficient to be clear about about work objectives and job performance. Supervising committees and working groups may designate someone, including another employee under their supervision, to act as a direct supervisor. Committees and working groups are expected to know and understand this Personnel Policy and are expected to play the roles intended for them in this policy.</p>
<p><b>Section 7-2 Evaluation</b></p>
<p><b>7-2.1 Probationary Period</b></p>
<p>All employees will be on probation for their first three months of employment. The probationary period is designed to allow the employee and GPCA to determine if they are a good fit for each other. During the probationary period GPCA may terminate employment if it wishes to re-open the hiring process. Changes of positions for current employees will not be subject to a probationary period.</p>
<p><b>7-2.2 Evaluation of Employees</b></p>
<p>Employees will be evaluated two weeks before the end of their probationary period, annually thereafter, and at such times as their supervisors may find necessary. Evaluations may result in employee termination or in a specific set of changes required to achieve a satisfactory evaluation. Employees are to evaluated solely on the basis of their work. However, drug or alcohol use will not serve as an excuse for poor work. All evaluations will become part of the employee's personnel records.</p>
<p><b>Section 7-3 Disciplinary Action, Unsatisfactory Job Performance, Dismissal</b></p>
<p>Employees may be dismissed by their supervisors, subject to confirmation by the Personnel Committee. During the three month probationary period described in 3.2.1, dismissal may be due to any unsatisfactory work or behavior by the employee. An unsatisfactory job performance evaluation is also a basis for dismissal. Employees evaluated as having unsatisfactory performance or requiring disciplinary action will receive written warning stipulating a reasonable length of time to rectify the problem(s). This can be followed by termination if the problem(s) are not corrected. In addition to any specific job requirements, employees may be dismissed for the reasons stated in Section 9.5 Malfeasance and Dismissal.</p>
<p><b>Article VIII Conditions of Employment - Independent Contractors</b></p>
<p><b>Section 8-1 Status</b></p>
<p><b>8-1.1 Independent Contractors (Contractors) are not GPCA employees. IRS rules will be followed to determine whether to classify a position as employee or contractor. When Contractors are hired, a contract must be signed, stating services to be rendered and payment. </b></p>
