------------------------------------------
(04) Decision: Approval of March 6th minutes,

Sponsor: Bert Heuer
Proposal: Approve the minutes for the March 6th meeting as recorded by Mimi Newton
Reference:http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/minutes/2017-03-06

NOTES:

Approved by consensus


------------------------------------------
(05) Discussion: Affirmation of June GA Dates

Sponsor: Victoria Ashley
Background and Purpose: At the March General Assembly (3/12/17) the host committee of the next GA (Sacramento) proposed the date as the weekend of June 24/25 (with the weekend of June 17/18 as a fallback). Since then, at least one conflict has arisen with the June 24/25 deadline. Host committee organizer Nicole Castor has acknowledged the concerns and and agreed with them. It was additionally discussed that finding a good venue (that can be reserved) is the most pressing issue, and that Sacramento will then make the final decision of which of the two June weekends will work best with the venue.
Proposal: That the Coordinating Committee affirm the potential choice of the weekend of June 17/18 for the June General Assembly in Sacramento County.

NOTES:

Camp Pollock reservation avaliable 6/17 and 18,  

June: reminded everyone of the decision process - originally approved for the 24th. Then date was moved since.

Tarik felt it would be a tight window

Eric asked about CalTrain

June says it's near CalExpo

Bert said he believed that the Sacto Muni ran near there (from CalTrain)

Approved by consensus


------------------------------------------
(06) Decision: Amend Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures  (10 minutes)

Proposal: See "Detail" below
Sponsor: Laura Wells
Background and Purpose:  In the past, when there have been multiple candidates for open seats on a standing committee, if even a single person held an unresolved concern about an applicant, none of the applicants were appointed and instead they all went to an online vote, which is the process when there are more applicants than seats available. This changes the process in the case where there are as many or fewer applicants as there are open seats.
Implementation/Timeline/Resources: This agenda item should precede agenda items having to do with appointing applicants to Standing Committees, and if approved should be implemented immediately.

Reference:
http://cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/procedures#Article_VI_Appointments_to_Standing_Committees


Detail:

Amend Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures regarding Appointments
to Standing Committees as shown...

EXISTING CC INTERNAL PROCEDURE

      6-4 Appointment
        If there are as many or fewer candidates than open seats, the Coordinating Committee shall first test for consensus on the full list  of candidates. If consensus exists, then all candidates shall be  considered appointed. Where there is not consensus, or where there are  more candidates than there are open seats, there shall commence a six  day voting period through midnight, the ensuing Sunday. During this time  discussion may continue on the Coordinating Committee email list.  Candidates shall be appointed by ranked choice voting, per GPCA Bylaws  7-1.8. As a further test, after the ranked choice vote is tabulated, a  candidate must also be ranked on at least 40% of the ballots to be  appointed. Both thresholds must be met for the appointment to occur.

AMENDED CC INTERNAL PROCEDURE

      6-4 Appointment

      If there are as many or fewer candidates than open seats, the Coordinating Committee shall first test for consensus on the full list  of candidates. If consensus exists, then all candidates shall be  considered appointed. Where there is not consensus, each candidate shall  be considered individually. If consensus is not reached on an individual  candidate, then a voice vote shall be taken during the call with a  majority threshold.

      Where there are more candidates than there are open seats, there shall commence a six day voting period through midnight, the ensuing  Sunday. During this time discussion may continue on the Coordinating  Committee email list. Candidates shall be appointed by ranked choice  voting, per GPCA Bylaws 7-1.8. As a further test, after the ranked  choice vote is tabulated, a candidate must also be ranked on at least  40% of the ballots to be appointed. Both thresholds must be met for the  appointment to occur.

NOTES:

Eric took over as facillitator so Laura could present.

No one asked clarifying questions

No affirmations or concerns

Approved by consensus


------------------------------------------
(07) Decision:  Appointments to Bylaws Committee

Proposal: The Bylaws Committee (and the applicants) request that the CC appoint Gloria Purcell (San Mateo County) and Jim Smith (Humboldt  County) to the Bylaws Committee.  Both applicants attended the Bylaws  Break Out session at the March 2017 General Assembly (as well as the  Bylaws Committee's March 19 teleconference).  Both applicants have  demonstrated a familiarity with bylaws in general and have been exposed  to the GPCA Bylaws, and Rules and Procedures to a sufficient degree that  the Bylaws Committee is confident that the applicants will contribute  significantly to the work of the Committee.
Sponsor: Mimi Newton, CC Liaison and Co Co of the Bylaws Committee, on behalf of the Bylaws Committee (and the applicants)
Implementation/Timeline/Resources: Upon implementation, the Bylaws Committee should update the website with the current information about  Bylaws Committee members as quickly as possible.  No other resources are  expected to be required, as the applicants were automatically added to  the Bylaws Committee list serv in accordance with the IT Protocol.
References:  Addendum A, Addendum B,http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_9-1_Membership   (9-1.1),http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_9-5_Bylaws_Committee  (9-5.2)

NOTES:

Eric asked whether anyone knew Jim Smith.  Mimi, Victoria, and Laura had met Jim Smith at the Bakersfield GA and were impressed.

Both approved by consensus.


------------------------------------------
(08) Decision: Appointment of Nicole Montoya to the IT Committee

Proposal: Add Nicole Montoya (San Diego) and Sadie Fulton (Yolo) to the single currently open seat on the IT Committee.
Sponsor: Bert Heuer
Background and Purpose: (TBD)
References: Addendum C and P

NOTES:

Laura: Mike Goldbeck resigned his position this morning.

Bert expressed that he had met both people and they would be fine

Ajay expressed his concerns about both applicants.  He felt they could assist w/o being on the IT committee itself.

Ann affrimed Nicole.

June read Sadie's application to the group. Mentioned Sadie introduced a useful app for organizing.  Mentioned that the two young women would be good communicators.  Also mentioned that gender balance. 

Ajay asked that we add people to IT that have more experience with "heavy IT"

Eric said that it would be good to have some new people who need to learn.  

Bert pointed out that sometimes it is good to teach young people and it would help us create procedure manuals.

Ajay agreed to stand aside his concerns 

Both approved by consensus.


------------------------------------------
(09) Decision Item:  Appointment to Media Committee (5 minutes)

Proposal: Appoint Cassidy Sheppard (Kern County) to Media Committee
Sponsor: Laura Wells
Background and Purpose:  Cassidy attended (actually facilitated) the Media Committee breakout session at the General Assembly in Bakersfield on March 12, and she volunteered to be on the Media Committee. SheÃ¢Â?Â?s got  experience; sheÃ¢Â?Â?s demonstrated herself to be very capable; and she'Â?s a millennial with great ideas.
Implementation/Timeline/Resources:
Reference: Addendum D (to follow)

NOTES:

Laura: Mike Goldbeck resigned this morning.

Eric agreed to facilitate so Laura could present.

Bert and Mimi both stated that Cassidy was bright and a go-getter.

Laura commented about how well she did at facilitating "on the fly" at a meeting late Sunday.

Eric added his affirmation.

Approved by concensus


------------------------------------------
(10) Decision Item: Appointments for Fundraising Committee

Proposal: Language TBD
Sponsor: Eric Brooks
Background: This is sent as a request for the April 3, 2017 Coordinating Committee Agenda, for a decision item to appoint 4 new members to the newly formed Fundraising Committee. I am the Liaison and therefore a Co-Coordinator of that committee. Wanda Jean Lord (Kern) has already been appointed as the female Co-Coordinator.

Detail: At the Bakersfield GA, 15 people attended the breakout for the committee of which the following four members are seeking appointment to the Committee:

Forrest Brown (Kern)
Gloria Purcell (San Mateo)

Ron Rodarte (Orange)
Erik Rydberg (Butte)

Reference: Addenda A, E, F

NOTES:

Eric: presented the names. Noted that Forrest Brown and Gloria Purcell withdrew their nomination. Affirmed Erik

June: affirmed Ron

Erik and Ron approved by consensus


------------------------------------------
(11) Decision: GPCA Insurance Statement

Sponsor: Victoria Ashley
Background and Purpose: Background and Purpose: (To be further developed) As more counties are activated and are becoming active, more requests for liability insurance coverage are being sent to GPCA. The current process for granting coverage, what the limits are, what information is needed by underwriters, is unclear. The purpose of this agenda item is to propose a process and a statement, amended as needed, in order to create an efficient process make it easy for our county parties to ask and receive the necessary information.
Proposal: For the CC to approve a blanket statement and process on which to address requests for insurance coverage for events and meetings, and a best method to communicate the information.

NOTES:

Vitoria rephrased the proposal as "For the Coordinating Committee to affirm that the Treasurer can respond to requests from GPCA counties for insurance coverage for events and meetings without direction by the Coordinating Committee or Coordinating Committee Co-Cos. Costs would need to be paid by the county and GPCA can reimburse counties if funds are available and budgeted"

June said that we should establish a set of criteria for making such requests. Also that the T should send us a report peridlcally.  Also if there is a fee for such insurance then the cost should be born by the counties

Eric wondered whether we need insurance at all for each event

Victoria wondered this as well.

Tarik said he had spoken to the Treasurer and was told that we did not need specific permission - we are insured for any function of the GPCA and whenever there is an event scheduled we just need to let the insurance company know about the event.

Mimi used to be an insurance litigator. Said it is a good idea to send a notice to the underwriter.

Ajay wondered whether or not the various requests applied to the state or to the county

Tarik answered that there is a difference between state events and county events as far as insurance is concerned.

Victoria reiterated she was trying to avoid having the CC approve every meeting of any type. 

June suggested we empower the CoCo (Bert) to approve the requests for insuring events (rather than the entire CC)

Laura asked whether or not we had a decision item to approve or not approve.

Eric suggested we make a decision item at least until 

Victoria restated the proposal as follows: The CC CoCo will review requests for proof of insurance and OK them to the Treasurer.

Ajay mentioned (and Bert twinkled) that should approval be granted for an event and something untoward occurred, the approver (as in CoCo) might be liable.

Laura suggested we learn a bit more about this process before carrying this proposal forward.  Twinkled by many.

Victoria agreed to be the point person for information gathering.

No proposal or decision.



------------------------------------------
(12) Discussion: The Next SGA: When, What and How

Sponsor: Victoria Ashley
Background and Purpose:(TBD)
Proposal: For the CC to exchange information on our understanding of the timeline and process to conduct the next online Standing General Assembly, what it will include, what the deadlines are, etc.

NOTES:

Victoria said she had not had time to flesh out this item but was concerned that the CC does not know enough about the SGA process.

Laura said she was recently looking at this stuff and would email some information

Eric reiterated that we really did need to get together ahead of the June elections

June thought that Laura's email would enlighted us.  But the only thing that she knew for sure was that the SGA had the CC elections and the US Delegations coming up.  Also that SGA delegates had to be approinted before electronic voting starts

Laura hoped that the bylaws information would tell us what we could add



-----------------------------------------
(13)  Decision: Agenda Submissions: Change to Internal Procedure

Proposal (Decision item): Modify the Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures such that proposals may be submitted as late 7 days ahead of a given Coordinating Committee meeting. Accordingly, the deadline for a  Co-Coordinator to post a draft agenda would be adjusted to 72 hours  before that meeting. The Co-Coordinator would then post a revised draft as late as 24 hours before the meeting, if needed.
Sponsor: Liz Kroboth
Background and Purpose: I am resubmitting this item, which I withdrew from last month's agenda since the Co-Co who has been taking a lead on  preparing agendas was not on the call. I am open to  amendments/discussion, since the goal is to more readily include items  submitted later than 2 weeks before a meeting. The current deadline of  submitting items 14 days before a CC meeting is excessively long and  problematic, given that there is only a month between meetings. It is  especially problematic when there is an online vote following a previous  meeting because it is nearly impossible to get those results back before  the two-week deadline, and we may want to add an item to the agenda  depending on those results.

Current deadlines for submitting items / drafting agendas as listed in the CC Internal Procedures are as follows:
-CC members submit items 14 days in advance
-Co-Co sends draft agenda 7 days in advance
-Co-Co sends revised agenda 72 hours in advance

Reference: Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures Section 3-3.2 and 3-3.5:http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/procedures

NOTES:

Eric asked for clarification

Laura restated: draft agenda out 72 hours ahead; 24 hours for revised draft additions; last draft 24 hours ahead

Bert stated that the real issue was setting the deadline for submitting draft agenda items.  The rest was OK.

June supported Liz' proposal.  Several twinkles.

Ann said she would support this but felt that an even shorter deadline would be good.

Approved by consensus


------------------------------------------
(14) Decision: Elected SGA Vote Administrator Proposal

Sponsor: Eric Brooks
Background: In 2016, during applications and SGA votes for Coordinating Committee members, it was discovered that there are no formal written procedures or protocols governing the very important task of appointing/electing Vote Administrators to implement and oversee votes taken by the SGA.

Note: The text of this decision item is substantially exactly the same as similar text in the SGA Email List Moderator item recently passed (to add sections 4-5 and 4-6 to the IT protocol) with the exceptions that 1) all text regarding email list moderation has been appropriately removed and 2) dates have been appropriately changed, and most importantly  3) proposed sections 5-1.7 and 5-1.8 below contain some substantive differences because they involve deciding disputes over voting procedures and results.

Proposal:  Revise the existing IT PROTOCOL of the GPCA to add section 5 as follows:

Article V. ELECTRONIC VOTE ADMINISTRATION

Section 5-1 Standing General Assembly (SGA) Vote Administrators

5-1.1 The Coordinating Committee shall elect a minimum of five nominees (with gender balance and from 5 different counties), subject to  3/5 approval by the Coordinating Committee using ranked choice voting in accordance with 7-2.4(a) of the GPCA bylaws, with the three highest ranked serving as SGA Vote Administrators to serve simultaneous two-year terms; and the next two ranked individuals to serve as Alternate SGA Vote Administrators for the same term. Terms shall run from June 1 to May 31 beginning in odd-numbered years. (For 2017 only, the CC will vote to approve the SGA Vote Administrators and alternates at one of the next two monthly meetings of the Coordinating Committee after adoption of this provision.)

5-1.2 All nominees must be Green Party members and be recommended to the Coordinating Committee by their County Council to be eligible. A call for SGA Vote Administrator applicants shall be sent to the GPCA Inform, GPCA Forum and SGA Votes Email lists by the IT Committee at the direction of the Coordinating Committee, within the first 15 days of April of each odd-numbered year.  For 2017 only, the call for SGA Vote Administrator applicants and alternates shall be sent within three (3) calendar days after adoption of this provision.)

5-1.3 In the event that an SGA Vote Administrator or Alternate seat is not filled by rank choice vote, the Coordinating Committee shall conduct an on-line vote to fill the seat(s).

Application of Gloria Purcell for appointment to the GPCA Bylaws Committee (dated 19 March 2017 at 9:43 pm)

Subject: Brief Bio

Biography:
My name is Gloria Purcell.  I have been married to an extremely patient man for 54 years, have four children and nine grandchildren and a close  extended family.  I am retired from the San Mateo County Library (SEIU),  am 75 years old, and an active GPCA volunteer and member since 1990.   During the mid-90's through 2000, I was on Bylaws Committee.  After the  restructure of the Bylaws, I lost my interest in the SC. Major family  concerns, and burnout from my four campaigns--1994, 1996 and 1998 City  Council and 2000 CA State Assembly-- kept me away from the GPCA for  years, and my local for about seven years also.  For many years I was on  the GP San Mateo County Council, even when sometimes it was inactive and  sometimes I was.  Most recently, I was 24/7 caregiver for my mother for  the last four years, and after she died in August 2016, busy with  executor duties.  Now I can start to be active in the GP again.

I was part of the group that started the original Bylaws and Platform for the GPCA, and the original national stab at setting up a document  that would become the basis of a national platform (Eugene OR 1988 or  89), because I am interested in structural solutions to social and other  problems and arrangements.  It is why I like architecture and  city/county planning and why I enjoyed being on the Belmont Planning  Commission and the Citizens Advisory Committee to the San Mateo County  Transportation Agency, approx. 1996-2000.

I hope to contribute to clarity, connectivity and openness of both process and result in our Bylaws updating.  The Green Party was  instrumental in forming my view of what social and governmental  structure could be, and I want to stick very close to our Ten Key Values  as we consider new changes.  I think you all are making a great start,  and hope I can keep up!  Full disclosure:  I am not very good with  computers and donÃ¢?Â¬Ã¢?Â¢t have a modern cellphone!

Thanks for the opportunity.

The Green Party of California Coordinating Committee:

Re:   appointment to the Bylaws Committee

I am a graduate of George Fox University in Newberg, Oregon and completed coursework for my teaching credential at U.C. Berkeley.  I  taught at several community colleges but was unable to find full time  employment so I went to work for the California Department of  Corrections at CTF Soledad.  I found that I was spending more time and  effort fighting departmental rules and policies more than teaching and  accepted employment with SEIU Local 1000 as a Labor Relations  Representative covering Humboldt, Del Norte, Mendocino, and Lake  Counties. During this tenure I was represented by UAW Local 2350.  I was  a steward and served on the by-laws committee for four years. I was  hired by AFSCME Council 57 and served as a business agent for several  locals including Humboldt County and Siskiyou Counties where a part of  my duties was to write and help implement local bylaws changes.  I also  organized locals in Del Norte County and several not for profit  organizations on the north coast and authored bylaws for all of those  entities.  All of the bylaws were accepted by the National Union as  adopted by the local union.

I am submitting this to you in hopes that I will be appointed to our bylaws committee.

I look forward to working with the Green Party.

In Solidarity,

Jim Smith

Application of Nicole Montoya

Dear GPCA Coordinating Committee Members,

When I first registered to vote in 2010, I felt like I was stuck with the dilemma of having to chose between Republican or Democrat. I figured I would be more Democrat since they were more towards the left; even though I didn't agree with a lot of their stances. Luckily for me being a Californian, I saw that I had other options on my form and Green was one of them. I quickly googled the Green Party on my phone and was thrilled to find a party that aligned with my beliefs.

I have always tried my best to do what I can to help my environment and community. Which is how I started in graphics helping local charities and schools with fliers and printouts. I attended college for a little over a year for accounting and graphic design. At that time I realized I could get things done quicker and taught myself markup languages and css to get working. I have worked as a front-end developer for over 4 years. During this time I was committed and open to learning more to better myself. I have worked with design, responsive templates, most CMSs, Git, jQuery, JavaScript, email marketing, and php. While not green, the largest site I assisted with more recently was GE automation combining it with its GE defense branch site.

I am fairly new to being active in politics. I knew whatever the outcome of this past election I would get involved. Recently I took over the maintenance of the GP of San Diego's website and email listings. At the GP General Assembly I was given the opportunity to voice my concerns about our current online whereabouts and to get involved with GROW. The CA Green's site needs to be revamped with a high dose of improved UI and that's just the beginning of the list. I feel like I can help the California Green Party renovate its current web presence; opening the door to new greens, and will benefit the IT Committee.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Nicole Montoya

Application of Cassidy Shppard

Hi, I'm Cassidy Sheppard. Since freshman year of high school I knew I wanted to go to school for journalism. The older I'e grown, the more I'e grown to be aware of the world around me and what is going on. I think we have a serious crisis on our hands and I believe the root of most of the problems going on in our country stem back to money. The first election I could vote in was this past election. In fact my 18th birthday was on election day. I started following Bernie Sanders in the summer of 2015 and stood by his side up until the DNC. Then I found Jill and followed her campaign because I felt she was the more radical Bernie Sanders. She was willing to say the things he wasn't.

Since then I'e started to become involved in local politics. I helped start up the Green Party of Kern County council. I have also been working with the Young Progressives Coalition of Central California. I helped canvas for a special election when a recent city council members committed suicide. If we would not have petitioned for a special election, the city council would just get to appoint someone. After receiving 1,500+ signatures the city council unanimously voted for a special election. I also started working for an organization called South Kern Sol which is a youth led media source. I made an ad that is on air currently on Radio Bilingue. The ad is about Kevin McCarthy voting record being swayed by the lobbyists and corporations funding him.

I am a current Sociology major at Taft College. I will be transferring to SFSU (fingers crossed) in fall of 2018 as a Political Science major and Cinema minor.

I would love to be a part of the Media Committee for the GPCA because I feel the world needs truth. And absolute truth is seldom found anymore. I want to ask the hard questions. My ultimate career goal is to save the world. To save the world we must save humanity. I believe that is possible through the Green Party.

Ronald Stacy Rodarte, Orange County, California

My Green Party Registration dates from my original registration in July 2003.

I've remained a registered Green since then, 14 years. I've been a member of the County Council for Many of those 14 years.

Experience

As a council member and host of the Presidential candidates over 4 Presidential election cycles and 3 midterm election cycles, our chapter has hosted speaking engagements of the candidates to raise funds. In 2015 our chapter stepped up to a higher level of production for fundraising and created an educational speaker's tour in Orange County. We raised funds to procure venues and speaker's honorarium for Dr. Richard Wolff and raised funds in a Packed house event. Observing the greater need to educate and register our county population that was rapidly becoming energized towards progressive ideas, we hosted Chris Hedges, Dr. Jill Stein and Mayor Gayle McLaughlin at a speaking event that drew a full house and made a considerably larger profit than the previous event.

Objectives for Green Party fundraising

County chapters are fundamentally non-funded. The creation of a speaker's educational tour for California chapters may offer timely, cutting edge insight into the experience of the American progressive beset by an all-out social program of repression and destruction of the commons can be a popular fundraising and informational experience that gives organizational responsibility and secures the energies of newer Green arrivals from debased "Dem-Repo" duopoly politics.

My goal is to use fundraising efforts for engaging the new registrants and prevent political drift caused by boredom and a feeling of apathy.

The first step in creating any fundraising apparatus is to create the tax-deductible entity so donors may receive value while supporting their best political interests.

The state of California has strict filing rules in place for declarations of candidate fundraising and penalties are handed out liberally. We must educate each of our county chapters to file responsibly, since one fine could debase an entire chapter due to one mistake in file protocol.

In all State fundraising efforts I feel strongly that the main objective is to assist the county chapters to create fundraising apparatus of their own and offer advice in filing the forms to the State that are due twice per year declaring fundraising activities.

Main Items:

* Despite the committee's ongoing discussion of moving to a new company to use for submitting reports to the SoS, the Treasurer went ahead and paid for the next year of the existing software, without mentioning it to anyone on the committee.  This was $1500 out of the less than $20k we have in the bank.  The Assistant Treasurer expressed concerns, especially given our low level of funds, that the Treasurer is not communicating about purchases that significantly impact our functioning.  I requested an email copy of the contract with the existing company (Statecraft) from the Treasurer, and received no response.
* We still need budget and work plans from all but one committee - Victoria will be sending out a reminder
* The Budget Committee will use the Finance Committee list (with the preface BUDGET:)
* Ruscal will be creating a new format for the June Budget which will be more user-friendly, not just a spread sheet but a report also.
* Moving our account to a credit union and moving our mailbox to the East Bay, possibly with RPA has entered the research phase

Report on Election Reform Working Group meeting at GA in Bakersfield - 3/12/17

Fifteen people attended the ERWG meeting, 13 of who were new to the ERWG.  Four of the new people were interested in becoming active ongoing members of the ERWG.

We discussed the various electoral reforms that are part of our platform and that Greens care about and decided to set priorities for a possible statewide ballot initiative.  Everyone understood that we would need to work with outside groups to be able to get an initiative on the ballot and run a campaign, so that compromise would probably be necessary.  (At the plenary the previous day, a presentation was made on the idea of an electoral reform ballot initiative which would repeal ?top two? and institute Ranked Choice Voting statewide.  A straw poll was taking regarding who supported this idea and virtually everyone present in the room raised their hand registered their support.)

The ERWG further discussed the ballot initiative idea.  We reached consensus that "top two" had to go as a first priority since the Green Party is prevented from participating in the general election when most people vote.   Our second priority was instituting Ranked Choice Voting which would help end fear-based/lesser-evil voting as the group felt that there is a lot of impetus for this reform at this time while other reforms we support like Proportional Representation would be a far bigger lift and we probably couldn?t get sufficient support to place PR on the ballot.  We all were committed to eventually achieving Proportional Representation (see below). 

Our third priority was to appeal to Berners (especially those who are not yet Green) by addressing in some fashion the problems Bernie supporters experienced in the primary election.  We had a lengthy discussion about open primaries and decided against supporting them because there it would be too easy to sabotage small parties like ourselves.  We reached consensus that Same Day Registration would prevent many of the problems Bernie supporters experienced and make it easier for many people to vote.  

Our number four priority was to put protections in place to make sure votes were properly counted.  Many of us were concerned about electronic counting of the vote and problems with the machines.

Our fifth priority was to include provisions to allow any city/county in California to adapt proportional representation if they so choose.

Some members of the group cautioned us that it might not be possible to put everything we want in one ballot initiative, and that the initiative should be as simple and straightforward as possible to maximize the opportunity of voter approval.

Dear Coordinating Committee of GPCA,

I am writing to ask you to consider me to serve on the Information Technology committee. I can offer the party a solid blend of technological competency, communications skills and a decade's worth of international activism.

I have a degree in Music Technology, which demonstrates the level of fluency, competency and comfort I have with computers and technology. I have done substantial work on the back-end of websites, WordPress blogs, mailing lists, newsletters, etc. When working as a full-time Trade Union Organizer in the UK, I was the go-to person for technological matters for my entire office.

My goal is to see the IT of the GPCA serving all of its registered members to a maximum effect. The networks we currently have are a great jumping-off point for a large outreach effort. We could also be taking greater advantage of mediums such as text messaging. I firmly believe now is the time for the Green Party to become stronger and more influential than ever before, and would like to help expand the IT infrastructure available to support us in doing so.

Kind regards,
Sadie Fulton
