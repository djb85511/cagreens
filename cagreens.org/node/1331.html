Feinstein (read a statement and also emailed it to the CC list, stating his outstating concern as:    €œAnn Menasche was not elected to the GPCA Coordinating Committee because write-in voting is not provided for in GPCA bylaws, nor has it ever been used nor counted in the GPCA €™s history for at-large Coordinating Committee seats http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_8-4_Elections; and because advocates for seating Ann Menasche failed to propose a bylaws interpretation under Article 13 of GPCA Bylaws that would have allowed this, which is the only procedure under party rules for which such write-in votes could be allowed http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Article_13-3_Bylaws_Interpretation." )

Rai (shares same concern.)

Thank you.

7)  Decision: Certification of Sacramento County Council (Victoria Ashley) (five minutes)

  

Proposal (Ashley): Certify the new County Council of Sacramento County

  

The minutes of the October 15, 2016 meeting and amended bylaws of the Green Party of Sacramento were received (sent in email on October 30 to CC list)

---------- Forwarded message ----------

From: nicole castor <nmcastorsilva>

Date: Sun, Oct 30, 2016 at 5:37 PM

Subject: Certification of Sacramento County Green Council

To: Victoria Ashley <victronix01>

  

I am writing on behalf of the forming Sacramento County Green Party Council (Green Party of Sacramento County), asking that you include in the agenda, for your next GPCA Coordinating Committee meeting, my request for the certification of our county council as a recognized Green Party County Council.

  

Our General Meeting was held on October 15, 2016, in a Sacramento County Public Library (ADA accessible).   This meeting was publicized, to Sacramento County Greens, twenty-one days in advance, by "email blast," sent by our GPCA Spokesperson, Mike Feinstein.   It was also promoted on social media and by word-of-mouth.     

  

At this meeting, bylaws were approved and a council of seven members were elected. It was also decided that appointments for specific officers would be decided at the next meeting, scheduled approximately one month after this first meeting.

  

The following Sacramento County Green Party Members were elected to council by consensus:

  

Jared Laiti

Gary Blenner

Michaela DeMarzi-Lay

Sharyn Obrigewitsch

Christopher Carlson

James Lee Clark

Nicole Castor

  

Please see the attached documents which show the minutes from this meeting as well as our amended bylaws.   Please feel free to contact me for anything you may need, in addition, to certify  our council.  

Sincerely,  

Nicole Castor

  

Feinstein stated that Sacramento amended their bylaws to change from 7 to 5 county council members, but because notice of the change didn't go to the Secretary of State in time the bylaw amendment didn't go into effect. Therefore the GP of Sacramento County was able to elect 7 members for their county council even though it appears in conflict with their bylaws.

  

Approved by consensus

_______________________________________________

    

8)   Decision: Certification of Yolo County Council  (Laura Wells) (ten minutes)

  

Proposal (Wells): Certify the new County Council of Yolo County

  

The minutes of the October 24, 2016 meeting and bylaws of the Green Party of Yolo County were received (sent in email on October 28 to CC list)

  

Concerns were raised that Yolo had not met the requirement of following the procedures in the bylaws of Section 6-6   Appointments to Vacancies in Counties In Which No County Council members were elected in the primary election http://www.cagreens.org/bylaws/2016-07-03#Section_6-6_Appointment_to_Vacancies_in_Counties_in_which_no_County_Council_members_were_elected_in_the_primary_election )

Addendum 1

  

In the presence of outstanding concerns, Wells withdrew the proposal

  

Wells stated she will work with the Greens in Yolo to assist them in following the procedures in the bylaws and will request help as needed to re-activate their county council so a proposal to certify them can be brought to a future CC meeting.

_______________________________________________

  

9)   Decision: Certification of Riverside County Council  (June Brashares) (ten minutes)

  

Note: this is the county that we tried to do an online vote to approve after the October meeting, but we never received the correct information from them.

Brashares had been told the number of Greens who attended the September 24 meeting in Riverside County were not sufficient to re-activate a county council so had not pursued it.

  

The information needed to certify a county council has not been received yet so Brashares withdrew the proposal.

  

Feinstein stated he was at the meeting on September 24 in Riverside County and was sure there were more than 20 Riverside Greens there. Jessy Lemieux was checking registrations and took minutes.

  

Brashares will try again to get the documentation from the Riverside County €™s September 24 meeting and would appreciate any help contacting Jessy Lemieux.

  

  

10) Report from Agenda team (Tarik Kanaana) (15 minutes)

  

Report on the planning for the General Assembly (GA) to be held in Ventura in 2017

  

Draft agenda is in process of development.  

  

Proposal (Kanaana): Do an online vote for approval of the Draft Agenda for a GA to be held Jan 7 - 8 in Ventura County.   

  

Amendment accepted by sponsor (Wells): Move GA to later in January or early February.

  

Amendment (Kanaana):   Instead of an online vote, the draft agenda for the GA will be submitted to be a decision item for the CC meeting on December 5th, 2016.

  

Amendment (Feinstein): Amend proposal for the GA to be scheduled for the weekend of the 3rd Sunday in February, Feb. 18 &amp; 19.   (Presidents day weekend).

  

Approved by consensus

  

_______________________________________________

  

11) Report on result of online vote

Decision: SGA Email List Moderation Proposal, As Modified (Newton) (15 minutes)

  

Action needed: A call for SGA Moderator applicants shall be sent to the GPCA Inform, GPCA Forum and SGA Votes Email lists

  

Everette sent out a draft to CC list.   CC members should send feedback within 48 hours.  
Newton will work with Everette on it.  

  _______________________________________________

  

12) Appointments of CC Liaison to all committees and working groups

  

This was supposed to be done some months ago after the July election.  

Bylaws Committee has made a specific request for a liaison from one of the current 6 members

  

Proposal (Brashares): Appoint Newton as CC Liaison to Bylaws Committee

  

Approved by consensus

  

Feinstein stated that the CC needs to appoint a Liaison to Electoral Reform working group (ERWG) at next CC meeting.

  

Heuer stated it will be agendized for the next meeting and he will work collecting info from Committees and Working Groups to make a list of the open positions for the next meeting.

  

  

13) Decision: Approval of Finance Committee Requests (Victoria Ashley) ( ten minutes)

  

Discussion was held about Finance Committee topics.
Due to lack of time the remaining items on the agenda were not discussed.

  

At 9:30pm the meeting was adjourned.    


A few people stayed on the call and had an informal discussion about Finance.

Addendum 1

Section 5-1 Recognition

5-1.1  A County Organization is considered recognized by the General Assembly if it adopts and files organizational bylaws with the Coordinating Committee and Bylaws Committee that are consistent with GPCA bylaws and California law, that:

5-1.1(a)  Describe the county's organizational structure, including membership and decision-making;

5-1.1(b)  Describe the process for filling County Council vacancies;

5-1.1(c)  Describe the process for selecting General Assembly delegates;

5-1.1(d)  Establish the position of county treasurer and describe the process for selecting it.

5-1.2  The Coordinating Committee shall certify, based on this Article, whether a County Organization has initially satisfied  5-1.1. Once a County Organization becomes recognized via this process, it shall retain that status unless it amends its bylaws to become non-compliant. Any decision by the Coordinating Committee regarding certification may be appealed to the General Assembly.  

Section 6-6 Appointments to Vacancies in Counties In Which No County Council members were elected in the primary election

6-6.1  The recognized or newly forming county organization must hold a General Meeting open to all registered Greens in the county. The meeting organizers shall work with the Coordinating committee to ensure that the meeting date, time and location is publicized as widely as possible to all Greens in the county, at least 21 days before the meeting.

6-6.2  To make an appointment at this General Meeting, the County Organization must already have bylaws as specified in  5-1.1, or must them adopt at the General Meeting.

6-6.3  For decisions to be valid at this General Meeting, in counties in which where there is not a recognized County Organization, the number of registered GPCA members in the county that must attend the meeting, must be at least three.

  

6-6.4  For decisions to be valid at this General Meeting, in counties in which where there is a recognized County Organization, either the number shall be equal to the amount that would be necessary to sign nomination signatures to appear on the County Council ballot in that county; or at a meeting with less than that number, but with at least three, only those candidates would be eligible who present a nomination petition with a number of signatures from registered Greens in the county, equal to the amount that would be necessary to sign nomination signatures to appear on the County Council ballot in that county.

6-6.5  The General Meeting must appoint at least one member to the County Council. Only registered Green Party members in the county are eligible for appointment. The county organization shall forward minutes of the meeting to the Coordinating Committee.

6-6.6  Once the Coordinating Committee has certified that the County Organization is recognized under  5-1.1, it shall review the minutes of the County Council election and certify the new County Council, unless there is clear evidence that the Council was elected in conflict with that County Organization's bylaws. Any decision by the Coordinating Committee not to certify may be appealed by that County Organization to the General Assembly and shall require a 2/3 vote to certify. If an in-person General Assembly is scheduled to occur within 60 days of the receipt of the petition, the Coordinating Committee shall place the vote on the draft agenda, and any agenda approved by the General Assembly must include the vote. If an in-person General Assembly is not scheduled to occur within 60 days of the receipt of the petition, the Coordinating Committee shall submit the petition for a discussion and vote of the Standing General Assembly at the next available starting date for on-line proposals, as defined in these bylaws.
