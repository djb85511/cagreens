<div><strong>SUBJECT: Draft Green Party of California (GPCA) Elections Code</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</strong> This is draft text for a Green Party of California (GPCA) section of the California Elections Code. The GPCA is seeking the following actions by the Senate Elections Committee: (1) forward the draft text for review and comment to the Legislative Analyst Office; (2) sponsor the reviewed text for approval by the legislature in the 2015 legislative session.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: </strong>When a political party qualifies for the ballot in California, by state law it must choose to operate under the Elections Code of another ballot qualified party, until it can get its own passed by the legislature. The Code primarily addresses two topics: Presidential Primaries and Party structure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the Green Party of California (GPCA) qualified for the ballot in January 1992, it chose the elections code of the Peace &amp; Freedom Party. At the same time it also won the right in the courts to have None of the Above (NOTA) in its party primaries, along other electoral reforms that sought to embody Green values in the electoral process and the party's structure (<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/history/election-rules-1992-1995">http://www.cagreens.org/history/election-rules-1992-1995</a>). However the GPCA lost NOTA upon appeal in 1995 in Green Party v. Jones (<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/history/nota/gpca-v-jones">http://www.cagreens.org/history/nota/gpca-v-jones</a>).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The following draft GPCA elections code grew out of a internal GPCA drafting process between 1999 and 2006 <span style="line-height: 1.538em;">(<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/elections-code">http://www.cagreens.org/elections-code</a>). Afterwards</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> the GPCA was not able to find a legislative sponsor for the bill, because the draft text contained sections mandating the use of ranked choice voting and none of the above in party primary and central committee elections. These the GPCA eventually learned would be unlikely for a legislator to sponsor, because if it were allowed for the Green Party it could be allowed for the other ballot qualified parties, and that was a controversy no legislator was interested in initiating. In 2012 after consultations with </span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">staff from the State Assembly Elections Committee and Speaker's Office of Member Services, a draft text without controversial context was created.  The result is the text below, with the primary differences compared to the Peace and Freedom Party's section explained first.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>* Primary change to the Peace &amp; Freedom elections code section regarding Presidential Primaries</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>1)</strong> (6960.5) The process for designating delegates to the Green Party national presidential convention would not be placed in the Elections Code (as it is for Peace &amp; Freedom). Instead the Code would reference GPCA's Bylaws and Rules and Procedures as the source. This would give the GPCA greater future freedom to make amendments without having to return to the legislature.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">*</strong><strong>Primary changes to the Peace &amp; Freedom </strong><strong>elections code section</strong><strong> regarding Party structure</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>2)</strong> (7901) Use 'County Council' instead of 'County Central Committee.'</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>3) </strong>(7929) Powers to appoint County Councils in some circumstances that are assigned to the State Central Committee in the Peace and Freedom Party are assigned to the Coordinating Committee within the GPCA.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>4) </strong>(7918) Use this text "Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a person may obtain and circulate nomination papers both for nomination to a public office and for election as a member of a county council." instead of this Peace and Freedom Party text "Each person receiving a Peace and Freedom Party nomination for any partisan public office at the preceding direct primary election or at any special election subsequent thereto shall be declared elected as a member of central committees. Any members elected pursuant to this section shall be in addition to the number a county is entitled to elect pursuant to Section 7752."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In its text, the GPCA would make it clear one can run for both types of office at the same time, but not that necessarily running for public office automatically elections someone to the County Council.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>* Additional Changes to GPCA's 2006 draft in Response to Legislative Staff memo of April 9, 2012 and phone conversation of April 17, 2012:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">5) </strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">(7930) Provide language to clarify that the Coordinating Committee will communicate to the Secretary of State, the identify of the GPCA Liaison to the Secretary of State, to address the concern that it may not be clear to the Secretary of State who it should speak to.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6) </strong>(7903) The manner in which the number of seats per County Council district would be determined is placed in the GPCA Bylaws, except a minimum and maximum would be placed in the code to guarantee that the GPCA could not decide to place a large, unreasonable number of seats on the ballot. Additionally a date by which this information would need to be communicated to the Secretary of State would be established, and this text is left blank on that date, with the request that the Secretary of State's office make a recommendation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>7)</strong> (7908) The manner in which an elected County Council member could be removed for cause would be placed in the GPCA bylaws.</div>

<div> </div>
<div><strong>CHAPTER 5. GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Article 1. General Provisions</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6960</strong> This chapter is applicable to the presidential primary ballot of the Green Party only. As used in this chapter, "Green Party" means the Green Party of California.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6960.5 </strong>The Green Party presidential primary ballot shall express the presidential preference of California voters who vote in the Green Party primary. National convention delegates shall be selected as provided for in the Bylaws and the Rules and Procedures of the Green Party and pursuant to the rules of the national political party with which the Green Party has affiliated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6960.7 </strong>A filing fee shall not be required from any person to be voted for in any Green Party presidential primary.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Article 2. Qualification of Candidates for Presidential Preference Portion of Primary Ballot</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6961</strong> The Secretary of State shall place the name of a candidate upon the Green Party presidential preference ballot when the Secretary of State has determined that the candidate is generally advocated for or recognized throughout the United States or California as actively seeking the presidential nomination of the Green Party or the national political party with which the Green Party has affiliated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6961.5 </strong>On or before the 150th day preceding a presidential primary election, the Secretary of State shall send a letter by first-class mail to the Green Party Liaison to the Secretary of State informing her or him that, while a response is not required, any information they wish to submit will be considered by the Secretary of State in the determination of candidates to be placed on the Green Party presidential preference primary ballot pursuant to Section 6961.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6962 </strong>On or before the 120th day preceding a presidential primary election, the Secretary of State shall publicly announce and distribute to the news media for publication a list of the candidates she or he intends to place on the ballot at the following presidential primary election. Following this announcement, the Secretary of State may add to her or his selection, but she or he may not delete any candidate whose name appears on the announced list. The Secretary of State shall mail a copy of the list and any subsequent additions thereto to the Green Party's Liaison to the Secretary of State.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6962.5 </strong>When the Secretary of State decides to place the name of a candidate on the ballot pursuant to Sections 6961 and 6962, the Secretary of State shall notify the candidate that her or his name will appear on the Green Party presidential preference primary ballot of this state.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6963</strong> If a selected candidate or an unselected candidate files with the Secretary of State, no later than the 68th day before the presidential primary, an affidavit stating without qualification that she or he is not a candidate for the office of President of the United States at the forthcoming presidential primary election, the name of that candidate shall be omitted from the list of names certified by the Secretary of State to the elections official for the ballot and the name of that candidate shall not appear on the presidential preference portion of the primary ballot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6963.5</strong> Any unselected candidate desiring to have her or his name placed on the presidential preference primary ballot shall have nomination papers circulated on her or his behalf. In order to qualify the name of that candidate for placement on the presidential preference primary ballot, the nomination papers of the candidate shall be signed by voters registered as affiliated with the Green Party equal in number to not less than 1 percent of the number of persons registered as members of the Green Party as reflected in the report of registration issued by the Secretary of State on the 135th day preceding the presidential primary election.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Article 4. Preparation, Circulation, and Filing of Nominating Papers</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6966 </strong>This article applies to the nomination of a Green Party candidate for the presidential primary ballot.</div>

<div> </div>
<div><strong>6967</strong> Each signer of a nomination paper for the presidential primary ballot may sign only one paper. The signer shall add his or her printed name and place of residence indicating city and giving the street and number, if any.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6967.5</strong> Any nomination paper may be presented in sections. Each section shall contain the name of the presidential preference candidate. Each section shall bear the name of the county in which it is circulated. Only voters of the county registered as affiliated with the Green Party are competent to sign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6968</strong> Each section shall be prepared with the lines for signatures numbered, and shall have attached the declaration of the circulator who obtained signatures to it, stating, under penalty of perjury, that he or she is a voter registered as affiliated with the Green Party, that all the signatures to the attached section were made in his or her presence, and that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief each signature to the section is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. No other declaration is required to be made.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6968.5</strong> A verified nomination paper is prima facie evidence that the signatures are genuine and that the persons signing it are voters registered as affiliated with the Green Party until it is otherwise proven by comparison of the signatures with the affidavits of registration in the office of the elections official.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>6969 </strong>The nomination paper for a candidate for the presidential preference ballot shall be in substantially the following form:</div>
