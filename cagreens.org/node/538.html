<p><strong>2. Approve Coordinating Committee Internal Rules and Procedures Articles II, II, VII and IX </strong><br /> </p>
<p><strong>Proposal: That the following text is approved (Feinstein, Laidman):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article II Work Plan and Long Term Agenda Planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2-1 Work Plan</strong></p>
<p>On an annual basis by the end of January each year, the Coordinating Committee shall prepare a yearly work plan along with any budget requests, in order to comply with GPCA Bylaws 6-2.1, which states "Each Committee and Working Group shall prepare a yearly work plan to be submitted to the Coordinating Committee along with any budget requests. The work plan must identify the objectives of the group for that fiscal year, any proposals it foresees bringing before the General Assembly, and a projected timeline for the group’s activities. The stated objectives must be congruent with the group's charge as defined in these bylaws and the goals and strategies of the GPCA."</p>
<p><strong>Section 2-2 Long Term Agenda Planning</strong></p>
<p>On an annual basis, the Coordinating Committee shall create a draft schedule for Coordinating Committee meetings, agenda items and on-line votes, based upon the timelines needed to fulfill the Coordinating Committee's responsibilities regarding General Assembly planning, committee appointments, liaisons appointments and other Coordinating Committee responsibilities contained in GPCA Bylaws and Rules and Procedures, as well as any other tasks identified in the yearly work plan. The draft schedule shall guide, but not mandate, individual agenda planning, except when legal or bylaws deadlines must be met.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Approved by Consensus</strong><br /> </p>
<p><strong>Proposal: That the following text is approved (Feinstein, Laidman):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article III Meetings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3-1 Regular Meetings</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of complying with GPCA Bylaws 7-1.3, which state that "Regular meetings of the CC shall be held at least once a month, in person or by teleconference. Date and location of the next regular meeting shall be determined at the close of each meeting or, failing this, shall be determined by the CC coordinators and announced with at least 20 days notice", the Coordinating Committee adopts the following:</p>
<p><strong>3-1.1</strong> Regular monthly meetings of the Coordinating Committee shall be held on the first Monday of each month, with three exceptions: (a) If there is a conflict with a national holiday; (b) if the meeting would occur on the night before a statewide election (primary, general or special), or (c) if it would occur the day after a General Assembly has concluded. In these cases, the regular monthly meetings of the Coordinating Committee may be rescheduled with at least 20 days notice, and the Coordinating Committee is encouraged to do so on an annual basis when these exceptions are easily anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>3-1.2</strong> Regular monthly meetings shall be for two hours.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3-2 Special Meetings</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of complying with GPCA Bylaws 7-1.3, which state that "a special (or emergency) meeting may be called with at least one week notice by the CC coordinators or a majority of the CC", and that all decisions made at a special meeting shall require 80% approval and that quorum shall be 2/3, the Coordinating Committee adopts the policy that special meeting agendas must be published at the same time that the meeting itself is called.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3-3 Draft Meeting Agendas</strong></p>
<p><strong>3-3.1</strong> For each Coordinating Committee meeting, a draft agenda shall be published that shall include those items for the Coordinating Committee to fulfill its duties and authority under GPCA Bylaws and Rules and Procedures.

<p><strong>3-3.3</strong> When submitted, agenda items submitted shall include whether it is a decision-making or discussion item or a report, a title and brief description, who are the anticipated presenter(s) and how much time is requested. If the item is a decision-making item, it should be submitted in the format specified in 3-4. While it is not always possible to present a proposal fully in advance of a meeting, sponsors are strongly encouraged to submit as much specificity about decision-making items in advance as possible and to provide supportive documents or references where needed.</p>
<p><strong>3-3.4</strong> Agenda items shall be ordered and assigned times by the Co-Coordinators. Facilitators, time keepers and vibes watchers shall be assigned by the Co-Coordinators as part of the agenda. Agenda items that were submitted on time but not included in the draft agenda shall be listed separately at the end of the agenda, with a brief explanation why they were not included.</p>
<p><strong>3-3.5</strong> A draft agenda shall be published seven days before the meeting, to the Coordinating Committee email list and to the password accessible Coordinating Committee meetings web page. In response to Coordinating Committee member feedback, the Co-Coordinators may revise the agenda and if so, shall publish a revised draft agenda no later than 72 hours before the meeting. During this time, sponsors of agenda items are strongly encouraged to send any remaining information about their item that may not have been available at the 14 day submission deadline.</p>
