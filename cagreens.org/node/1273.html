For the first time , Nationbuilder has told us that before we sent out any more email blasts, we need to start &lsquo;verifying&rsquo; them first to weed out further bad emails.&nbsp; We were already shut down once after we did a blast with new data from the LA Registrar from May, that we had not &lsquo;cleaned&rsquo; beforehand.&nbsp;<br /><br />The GPCA has done a test work with Accurate Append to clean emails for outreach for re-organizing/re-activating party meetings in six counties: Kern, RIverside, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, San Mateo and Stanislaus.<br /><br />After September 15, Nationbuilder will be importing a new voter registration list from the CA Secretary of State, with new list from each county, including the email addresses from each. Before the GPCA emails to that new list, it is going to need to be cleaned. &nbsp;<br /><br />After this list is imported, the IT Committee will seek an estimate on how much it will be to clean this list and how much to append additional addresses and make a recommendation. The GPCA has been promised $5,000 from the Jill Stein campaign to use towards November 2016 campaign costs. Arguably improving the GPCA email data base for campaign outreach could qualify for some of those funds. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>GPCA Fiscal Policy Section 7-6 Emergency funding states:<div>&nbsp;</div><div>7-6.1 Requests for disbursal of funds exceeding the amount budgeted for a specific purpose may be made by standing committees and working groups and be considered by the Coordinating Committee on an emergency basis.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>7-6.2 To authorize an emergency disbursal the Coordinating Committee must approve of a statement of findings why such an out-of-budget expenditure is in the substantial interest of the party and how it will be paid for, and must forward this approval to the Treasurer. Such findings shall be based upon meeting Party needs associated with the following:</div><br /><strong>Proposal:&nbsp;</strong>That the Coordinating Committee approve the statement of findings.</div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the ability to reach Green Party members during the Jill Stein for president campaign is a high priority; and</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the ability to email Green Party members is the most inexpensive large-scale way the GPCA can contact its members; and</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the state of California is releasing its first ever list of Green Party members with email address in September 2016; and</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the GPCA must clean the list it gets from the Secretary of State of bad addresses, in order to comply with Nationbuilder&rsquo;s policies, with whom the GPCA sends out its email blasts and</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the GPCA can append additional email addresses not contained in the voting registration list of Green Party members by purchasing them from Green Party members; and</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Whereas the Jill Stein for president campaign has made $5,000 available to the GPCA for outreach strategies and expenses,&nbsp;</div><div><p>Therefore the GPCA Coordinating Committee authorizes up to $5,000 of the funds from the Jill Stein for President campaign for use by the GPCA IT Committee to clean its Green voter registration list of bad emails and to purchase (append) additional emails of Green Party members, for &nbsp;use in outreach to GPCA members</p><p>Yes:&nbsp;<strong>Marla Bernstein</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Sanda Everette</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Mike Feinstein,&nbsp;Bert Heuer</strong>,<strong>Tarik Kanaana</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Sasha Karlik</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Matt Leslie</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ajay Rai</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Karinna Zarate, (8)</strong></p><p>No:&nbsp;<strong>Victoria Ashley</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Eric Brooks,&nbsp;Trini Castaneda</strong>,<strong>Susan Chunco</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mike Goldbeck</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mike Murphy</strong>,<strong>Mimi Newton</strong>, Liz Kroboth,&nbsp;<strong>Laura Wells (90</strong></p><p><strong>menasche</strong></p><p>Abstain:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>June Brashares</strong>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lynne Sandoval</strong>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Stephen Zollman</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><hr /><p><br /><strong>11) D</strong><strong>iscussion: Approval of &nbsp;amendment to GPCA IT Protocol to establish new Section 4-5 Standing General Assembly (SGA) Email Lists and new Section 4-6 SGA Email List Moderator Compliance and Enforcement&nbsp;</strong>(Newton) (twenty minutes)</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><hr /><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Background: &nbsp;The Coordinating Committee Sub-Committee established at the Coordinating Committee&rsquo;s July meeting to establish moderation procedures for the Standing General Assembly email list has meet via teleconference and email and is submitted the two new sections as amendments to the IT Protocol&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/it-protocol" target="_blank">http://www.cagreens.org/it-protocol</a>.&nbsp;

Recently both a member&nbsp;of the CC, and a CC email list administrator, each stated that certain emails being posted by CC email list&nbsp;members were &lsquo;off topic&rsquo;. A majority of GA members have made clear that they do not support preemptive&nbsp;restriction of emails as &lsquo;off topic&rsquo; without a better complaint and decision making process being established.&nbsp;However, it will take some time to establish and implement these new procedures. Therefore it will help fulfill&nbsp;the will of the GA in a more timely fashion to immediately rotate the SGA list administrators, and to provide&nbsp;guidance to the CC email list administrators (the CC Co-Coordinators) so that new administrators and new&nbsp;guidance can bring a fresh perspective to SGA and CC list administration; administration which in turn will more&nbsp;closely follow the will of the GA.<br /><br />Proposal:<br />&nbsp;<br />That the administration of the&nbsp;<a href="mailto:gpca-votes@cagreens.org" target="_blank">gpca-votes@cagreens.org</a>&nbsp;email list shall be immediately rotated and that three&nbsp;new administrators shall be chosen to administrate the list via a vote or votes of the CC immediately following&nbsp;the approval of this item; and that the Co-Coordinators of the CC shall be directed to adopt email list&nbsp;administration practices which are consistent with the will of the GA membership on SGA list administration. (To&nbsp;facilitate timely implementation, administrators chosen may be, but are not required to be, CC members.)<br /><br />Implementation/Timeline/Resources:<br /><br />Immediately upon enactment of this proposal by the CC, CC members will then choose the three member SGA&nbsp;email list administration team and work with the IT and any other committee deemed necessary to implement the&nbsp;proposal. Those chosen to the SGA administration team will have their roles finalized pending agreement by each&nbsp;person chosen to serve in their administrator role. If not all chosen agree to serve, applications for serving as&nbsp;SGA list administrators will be called for from Green Party members (to be submitted at least two weeks prior&nbsp;to the next regular CC meeting) to fill any remaining administrator seats, and then the CC will vote on those&nbsp;applicants at that next regular meeting.<br /><br />References: Provided on request if members have questions requiring them.<br />&nbsp;<hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>17​) Decision: &nbsp;Monthly Rotation Of CC Agenda Drafter &amp; Facilitato</strong>r&nbsp; (Brooks)<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />For quite some time, the Coordinating Committee Co-Coordinators (and very few others) have regularly taken on&nbsp;the responsibility of agenda drafting and Facilitation for our monthly Coordinating Committee meetings.&nbsp;Consensus based groups which do not regularly rotate these meeting management responsibilities face the very&nbsp;likely danger of falling into ineffective decision making and internal conflict, and/or burnout of the individuals&nbsp;continually filling these roles, and it is very important that these responsibilities be rotated for each meeting.<br /><br />Proposal:<br />&nbsp;<br />That the Coordinating Committee shall establish that each Coordinating Committee regular agenda shall have an&nbsp;automatically scheduled item for the setting of the Agenda drafter and Facilitator for the next regular meeting,&nbsp;that it shall be established that a CC member shall not serve as a Facilitator for more than 2 regular CC&nbsp;meetings in succession, that a CC member shall not serve as a Facilitator for more than 3 regular CC meetings in&nbsp;any given calendar year, that a CC member shall not serve as an agenda drafter for more than two regular CC&nbsp;meetings in succession, and that a CC member shall not serve as both a Facilitator and agenda drafter for the&nbsp;same meeting. The following Internal Procedures changes shall be enacted to implement this decision:<br /><br />Coordinating Committee Internal Procedures, Article I: Co-Coordinators, Section 1-2: Duties and Authority,&nbsp;andCoordinating Committee Internal Procedures,&nbsp;Article III Meetings, Section 3-3 Draft Meeting Agendas,&nbsp;shall&nbsp;be edited as follows:<br /><br />The current text:<br /><br />1-2.1&nbsp;Create draft agendas for Coordinating Committee meetings, according to the process described in 2-1;<br /><br />shall be replaced with:<br /><br />1-2.1&nbsp;Arrange for the creation of draft agendas for Coordinating Committee meetings, post those agendas&nbsp;to Coordinating Committee members, and arrange for facilitators to coordinate those meetings, according&nbsp;to the processes described in 2-2, and 3-3;<br /><br />the&nbsp;current text:<br /><br />Section 3-3 Draft Meeting Agendas<br /><br />shall be replaced with:<br /><br />Section 3-3 Draft Meeting Agendas and Assignment of Meeting Roles<br /><br />and the current text:<br /><br />3-3.4 Agenda items shall be ordered and assigned times by the Co-Coordinators. Facilitators, time keepers and&nbsp;vibes watchers shall be assigned by the Co-Coordinators as part of the agenda. Agenda items that were&nbsp;submitted on time but not included in the draft agenda shall be listed separately at the end of the agenda, with a&nbsp;brief explanation why they were not included.<br /><br />shall be replaced with:<br /><br />3-3.4 Agenda items shall be ordered and assigned times by the Co-Coordinators. Agenda items that were&nbsp;submitted on time but not included in the draft agenda shall be listed separately at the end of the&nbsp;agenda, with a brief explanation why they were not included. Each agenda shall have as its first decision&nbsp;item, the choosing of two committee members, respectively, to be the agenda drafter and Facilitator for&nbsp;the next regular Coordinating Committee meeting. A Coordinating Committee member shall not serve as a&nbsp;Facilitator for more than 2 regular meetings in succession, shall not serve as a Facilitator for more than 3&nbsp;regular meetings in any given calendar year, shall not serve as an agenda drafter for more than two&nbsp;regular meetings in succession, and shall not serve as both a Facilitator and agenda drafter for the same&nbsp;meeting. At the beginning of each meeting time keepers, note takers, and vibes watchers shall be assigned&nbsp;by consensus (with a fall back to a simple majority vote). If made necessary by the absence of a member&nbsp;previously assigned as Facilitator, the Coordinating Committee may, by consensus (with a fall back to a&nbsp;simple majority vote) waive the rules in 3-3.4 and choose a new facilitator for a Coordinating Committee&nbsp;meeting.<br /><br />Implementation/Timeline/Resources:<br /><br />Immediately upon enactment of this proposal by the CC. The current meeting Facilitator will call for volunteers&nbsp;to fill the roles of Facilitator and agenda drafter for the next meeting and CC members will then choose from&nbsp;the volunteers by consensus (or by a fallback on a simple majority vote if consensus cannot be reached) who shall&nbsp;fill each role. (A person being chosen for the Facilitator role may not also be chosen to fill the agenda drafter&nbsp;role and vice versa). Those chosen to fill future Facilitator and agenda drafter roles will then work with the CC&nbsp;Co-Coordinators to make sure that they understand and have the proper protocols, tools and logistic&nbsp;understandings needed to properly serve their roles in a timely and efficient manner.&nbsp;<br /><br />References:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/procedures" target="_blank">http://www.cagreens.org/committees/coordinating/procedures</a><br /><br />-end-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><br /><br />ATTACHMENT #1:&nbsp;<strong>​Decision: Approval of &nbsp;amendment to GPCA IT Protocol to establish new Section 4-5 Standing General Assembly (SGA) Email Lists and new Section 4-6 SGA Email List Moderator Compliance and Enforcement&nbsp;</strong>(Newton) (twenty minutes)<br /><br />Part 1.
