<p><strong>7-5.1 Draft Agenda</strong></p>
<p>7-5.1(a) The Coordinating Committee shall establish a Draft Agenda for all General Assembly meetings, distribute it at least 42 days in advance to each County Organization and submit it for approval at the beginning of each General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.1(b) </strong>The Draft Agenda shall incorporate agenda items submitted by committees, working groups and County Organizations as provided for in these bylaws; shall distinguish among decision making items, reports and discussion items; shall distinguish among proposals, elections and confirmations; and shall include facilitators, times and the full text of each item as described in <a href="818.html#7-2.2">7-2.2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.1(c)</strong> The Draft Agenda may contain a Consent Calendar consisting of proposals that have been judged by their sponsors to be sufficiently non-controversial as to be considered and approved without the normal consensus-seeking process of presentations, clarifying questions, and affirmations and concerns. When the Consent Calendar is heard, any proposal for which there are outstanding concerns without stand asides shall be removed without approval. The sponsor(s) of the proposal shall make an effort to address the outstanding concerns, after which the proposal may be brought back to the General Assembly at a later point for approval.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.2 Delegate Registration</strong></p>
<p>Delegates shall register at the beginning of each day of a General Assembly, identifying their county. Delegates who permanently leave the General Assembly before it is adjourned shall notify the facilitators (or other appropriate officials) and shall be removed from the delegate registration count for the purposes of calculating quorum.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.3 Quorum</strong></p>
<p>7-5.3(a) A quorum exists for the purpose of opening a General Assembly when 2/3 (rounding to the nearest whole number) of the regions containing active counties are represented.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.3(b) </strong>A quorum exists for the purpose of decision-making when 80% of registered delegates are present and a minimum of 90% of the maximum number of delegates registered for that day are present, if delegates earlier present have left and unregistered.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.3(c) </strong>Facilitators shall conduct a roll call to establish a quorum at the beginning of each session of the General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.4 Facilitation</strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.4(a)</strong> The Coordinating Committee shall designate at least one facilitator and preferably two co-facilitators for all General Assembly sessions. Approval of facilitators shall be included as part of the approval of the Draft Agenda. Facilitators must be GPCA members.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.4(b) </strong>Facilitators shall be chosen who can facilitate the General Assembly according to the consensus-seeking process in <a href="818.html#Section_7-5_Meetings">7-5</a>, who can provide non-directive leadership and process clarity, and who honor the agenda and promote good will. A facilitator shall not give her/his personal opinion unless clearly stepping out of her/his role as a facilitator. Facilitators should be familiar with the Ten Key Values and the GPCA's Purpose, Bylaws, and Rules and Procedures. The use of gender-stacking, where the order of the "stack" would alternate between one woman, one man, shall be considered as a first choice for use by the facilitators.</p>
<p><strong><a id="7-5.5" name="7-5.5"></a>7-5.5 Consensus Seeking</strong></p>
<p>Consensus shall be sought according to the following process:</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(a) </strong>Delegates shall be given priority in decision-making discussions. At the discretion of the facilitation team and time permitting, other GPCA members and guests may participate. Only delegates may hold outstanding concerns.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(b) </strong>Presenters shall present their proposal, after which clarifying questions are taken from the delegates and responded to by the presenter(s).</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(c)</strong> Affirmations, concerns and proposed amendments follow from the delegates only. Presenters attempt to address concerns and may amend their proposal, in which case clarifying questions may again be made and responded to by the presenters. The proposal is then restated, including as amended, if amended by the presenters.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(d) </strong>The facilitator(s) should ask if there are any more unresolved, outstanding concerns. If there are none, the proposal is considered approved by consensus.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(e)</strong> If there remain outstanding concerns, the facilitators ask whether those holding outstanding concerns are willing to "stand aside" and have their concerns recorded in the minutes, along with the adopted proposal. If so, the proposal is considered approved by consensus, with the stand asides recorded.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(f) </strong>If there is not consensus, the presenter(s) may request more time from the General Assembly, go to a vote or withdraw the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(g)</strong> If the presenter(s) go to a vote, the facilitators shall conduct a roll call and record each delegate's vote as "yes", "no" or "abstain". Passage shall be according to the approval thresholds in <a href="http://cagreens.org/bylaws/7-2.3">7-2.3</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.5(h)</strong> If more time is added by the General Assembly, the presenters may attempt to address the remaining outstanding concerns, and may amend their proposal, in which case clarifying questions may be made and responded to. The proposal is then restated, including as amended, if amended. The process is then repeated to identify any outstanding concerns and whether those holding them are willing to stand aside. If there are no outstanding concerns, or if those holding them are willing to stand aside, the proposal is considered approved by consensus. If outstanding concerns remain, the presenters may go to a vote or withdraw their proposal.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.6 Minutes</strong></p>
<p>The Coordinating Committee has the responsibility to ensure that minutes are taken at each General Assembly. Minutes shall include the date, time, location and list of delegates in attendance, the subject/title, sponsor(s) and presenter(s) of all agenda items heard, the decisions-taken (including whether by consensus or by roll-call vote) and the text of all proposals, including amendments.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.7 Points of order</strong></p>
<p><strong>7-5.7(a)</strong> Any delegate may signal the facilitator(s) by raising two hands on a Point of Clarification if they do not understand the process. The Point of Clarification shall be heard before moving on to other speakers.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.7(b) </strong>Any delegate may signal the facilitator(s) by raising two hands on a Point of Information to provide a critical piece of information otherwise missing in the discussion. Delegates are expected to utilize this option sparingly and judiciously.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.7(c)</strong> Any delegate may signal the facilitator(s) by raising two hands on a Point of Process, if they believe the process being followed violates GPCA Bylaws, Rules and Procedures, Fiscal Policy or other such procedures adopted by the General Assembly. Before moving on to other speakers, the Point of Process shall be heard and the facilitator(s) shall rule upon it.</p>
<p><strong>7-5.8 Setting Next Meeting</strong></p>
<p>The date and location for the General Assembly shall be determined by the close of each meeting. Should the General Assembly fail to make this determination, it shall become the responsibility of the Coordinating Committee to do so. The General Assembly may set more than one meeting date and location at a time.</p>

<p>In cases of ambiguity or procedural disagreement, the General Assembly shall decide for itself the meaning of its governing documents, the appropriate procedure to be followed and what amendments are necessary to resolve any further ambiguity or disagreement. Between General Assembly meetings, the Coordinating Committee shall decide these questions and the Bylaws Committee is charged with assisting with the Coordinating Committee in this process by providing analysis. Such Coordinating Committee determinations are subject to a 2/3 confirmation by the General Assembly. If the Coordinating Committee makes such a determination within 60 days of the receipt of the petition, the Coordinating Committee shall place the vote on the draft agenda, and any agenda approved by the General Assembly must include the vote. If an in-person General Assembly is not scheduled to occur within 60 days of the receipt of the petition, the Coordinating Committee shall submit the decision for confirmation by the Standing Green Assembly for an on-line discussion and vote at the next available starting date for on-line proposals, as defined in these bylaws.</p>
