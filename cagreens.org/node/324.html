<p><strong>What are County Councils?</strong></p>
<p>The County Council is the legal body of the GPCA on the county level and is generally responsible for organizing and coordinating Green Party activity within the county, including party building, internal and external communications, supporting local Green candidates and representing county Greens to the state Green Party.  Green Party County Councils are elected in the presidential primary election every four years by registered Greens. County Councils hold public meetings and are governed by their own <a href="http://cagreens.org/bylaws/county" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 116, 189); text-decoration: none; ">county bylaws</a>.</p>
<p>All political parties in California are governed by the <a href="http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=elec&amp;codebody=&amp;hits=20">California Elections Code</a>. The Code specifies the duties and qualifications of all political parties, including their state and county organs.  The Green Party calls its elected County organizations ‘County Councils’.  Other parties call theirs ‘Central Committees’ or ‘County Central Committees’.<a name="how-run" id="how-run"></a></p>
<p><strong>How does one qualify for the ballot?</strong><strong> Who is eligible to run?</strong></p>
<p>To run for County Council, one must be a registered Green in the district in which one seeks election. (<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=200-202">E.C. § 201</a>) and have been registered Green at least three months prior to the opening of the nomination filing period, which begins in 2016 on January 4th. (<a href="http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&amp;group=07001-08000&amp;file=8000-8005">E.C. § 8001(a)</a>). </p>
<p>To qualify for the ballot, a potential County Council candidate must gather twenty nomination signatures from registered Greens in the district (fewer in counties with less than 1,000 registered Greens). These signatures are then checked for validity by the County Registrar. If enough are valid, one's name is placed on the ballot for a public vote of registered Greens. (If the number of candidates is less than the number of positions available, all of the candidates will be declared winners, and you will not see the position on your ballot.)</p>
<p>The signature gathering period in 2016 is between January 4 and March 11, dates that correspond to E-158 and E-88, indicating the number of days before the County Council election. (<a href="http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&amp;group=08001-09000&amp;file=8020-8028">E.C. €€ 8020</a> &amp; <a href="http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&amp;group=10001-11000&amp;file=10400-10418">10407</a>). To initiate this process, one must go to the County Registrar's office to fill out the declaration of candidacy, obtain the official signature gathering forms and to hand them in upon completion.  <strong><a name="calculate-size" id="calculate-size"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the official size of your County Council</strong></p>
<p>The California state elections code states: <em>7903. The number of members of the county council to be elected in a county shall be a minimum of three and a maximum of 50, and the process in which each county’s number shall be calculated shall be defined in the Green Party’s byla</em>ws </p>

<p><strong>6-1.2</strong> A County Organization's bylaws must specify the number of members to be elected in the county.<br /><strong>6-1.3</strong> If a county has less than 150 registered Green Party voters, the number of members to be elected shall be three;<br /><strong>6-1.4 </strong>If a county has between 150 and 500 registered Green Party voters, the number of members to be elected shall be five;<br /><strong>6-1.5</strong> If a county has more than 500 registered Green Party voters, the number shall be either:<br /><strong>6-1.5(a)</strong> The greater of the number seven or the integer nearest the resulting quotient obtained by dividing 100 times the number of Green Party registered voters in the county by the number of Green Party registered voters in the state; or<br /><strong>6-1.5(b)</strong> Recognized County Organizations may choose to modify the number of members to be elected by notifying the Coordinating Committee at least 165 days prior to the direct primary election, notification of which must include minutes of the decision that took place.

It shall be the responsibility of the Coordinating Committee to notify the Secretary of State of the modification no later than 135 days prior to the direct primary election.</p>
