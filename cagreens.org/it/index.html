<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>These groups of lists are &quot;managed&quot; by IT</p>

<h4>Email Lists</h4>
<p>A list of Green Party email lists to which you can subscribe is at
<a href="http://lists.cagreens.org/mailman/listinfo/">http://lists.cagreens.org/mailman/listinfo/</a>.
These are the lists hosted on Mailman. There are a few other lists on
Majordomo that are not included here. Our goal is to move all lists to
Mailman. Also, there are a few private lists that are by invitation only
and are not listed here.</p>

<h4>Broadcast Lists</h4>
<p>View the <a href="broadcastlist.shtml.html">rules and procedures</a> that
govern the operation of our broadcast lists, which are the County Contact
list and the Updates list. Read <a href="format.shtml.html">these tips</a> on
formating your messages for the broadcast lists.</p>

<h4>General Discussion List</h4>
<p>We have a list called
<a href="http://marla.cagreens.org/mailman/listinfo/cal-forum">greens-cal-forum</a>
where Greens discuss a variety topics in an unmoderated setting.</p>

<h4>County Contacts</h4>
<p>This is a <a href="http://cagreens.org/it/county/contacts/cntylist.html">listing of all
the contacts</a> used to compose the official County Contacts list.
Instructions for accessing the list <b>archive</b> is also explained on
this page. And, you will find a link to the <b>Request Form</b> for
adding contacts. That form also describes how the county contact system
operates. See also the rules for broadcast lists, above. <i>The common
GPCA password is required.</i></p>

internal pages. This password is changed anually after the first General
Assembly of each year.</p>
