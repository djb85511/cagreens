&lt;p&gt;PO Box 485, San Francisco, CA 94104                                For Immediate Release: April 25, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact: Eric Brooks, 415-756- 8844 Laura Wells, 510-504- 4254 Erik Rydberg, 530-781- 2903&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CALIFORNIA GREEN PARTY WIDENS ENDORSEMENTS TO OTHER PARTY CANDIDATES FOR THE FIRST TIME&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco, CA – The Green Party of California (GPCA) announced today that for the first time in its three decade history, it has voted to endorse candidates from other parties in statewide elections. GPCA delegates voted by a two-thirds supermajority to allow the Greens to endorse any candidates who do not accept corporate campaign contributions, and who do not belong to a political party that accepts corporate contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to endorsing Green Josh Jones for Governor, the GPCA endorsed non-partisan Gayle McLaughlin for Lieutenant Governor, and four Peace and Freedom Party statewide candidates, John Parker for U.S. Senate, Mary Lou Finley for State Controller, Kevin Akin for State Treasurer, and Nathalie Hrizi for Insurance Commissioner. Akin, who is the current State Chair of the Peace and Freedom Party, said that the endorsements &quot;are very helpful and much appreciated, and should help us get substantial votes in the June 5th Primary. In these times of crisis, working people need to unite to defend themselves and push for peace, against austerity, and to protect our rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the so-called Top Two Primary, voters in California were promised more moderate candidates and more competitive races,” said GPCA spokesperson and former Governor candidate Laura Wells. “But instead, voters in November see only candidates who are funded by Super PACs, corporations and billionaires, and often see only two Democratic or two Republican candidates to choose from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before Top Two, candidates from parties like the Greens, Libertarians, and Peace and Freedom were always on the November ballot,” Wells said, “This kept single-payer health care on the table, in addition to other advancements like living wages, police and prison reform, properly funded schools, free college tuition, and public banks - as well as electoral reforms like ranked choice voting, getting money out of politics, and proportional representation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reaching across party lines, Greens intend to improve the chances for progressives and independents to make it to the November ballot to be heard and elected. Following the 2016 election, with an infusion of former Bernie Sanders organizers, the GPCA has grown by 50% adding 12 new active counties. “This played a role in the expanded endorsements decision.” Wells said, “And several former Sanders supporters are running for office as Greens now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Rydberg, a GPCA Spokesperson and former Sanders organizer now running for California Secretary of State, said he learned two key lessons from the 2016 election, “One, that no real change is ever going to come from the Democrats and the Republicans because of the iron fist of corporate control over those parties. And two, that the only way to defeat the corporate parties is for revolutionary electoral movements like the Green and Peace and Freedom parties to join together as a force to be reckoned with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another former Sanders organizer, Green Party candidate for Governor, Josh Jones, pointed to the fact that California is still engaging in oil fracking, a practice widely objected to by California voters. “The politics of the 20 th century are over, and are being replaced by a 21 st century politics of unity to challenge the corporate control and endangerment of every aspect of our lives. Multi-national corporations like Chevron, Shell and BP are working to manipulate our elections and steamroll our environmental laws for shareholder profits. A change in political leadership is an imperative for social and environmental survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPCA Standing General Assembly confirmed on Monday, April 15, that the Green Party of California has endorsed the following statewide candidates for the June 2018 primary election:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor - Josh Jones, Green Party of California&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.josh4gov.org&quot;&gt;https://www.josh4gov.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Greens call out Democratic Party for once again killing California’s hopes for single-payer healthcare</title>
 <link>https://cagreens.org/greens-call-out-democratic-party</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/calcare1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR RELEASE: February 3, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greens call out Democratic Party for once again killing California’s hopes for single-payer healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO, CA - February 3, 2022 — Despite the Democratic Party’s super-majorities in both houses of the legislature, CalCare (AB 1400), the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, was pulled on Monday, January 31, just before the Assembly floor vote, by its primary author, Assemblymember Ash Kalra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cited the need to gather more support from Democratic Assemblymembers as the reason, but his action denied voters the opportunity to learn where their representatives stand on the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the majority of California Democratic Assemblymembers do not support a single-payer system when the vast majority of their constituents do is inexcusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll [1] by Physicians for a National Health Program on Medicare for All healthcare conducted during last fall’s attempted recall of Governor Newsom showed that 60% of voters – and 86% of Democratic-leaning base voters – supported a state Medicare for All healthcare system in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not only would I sign AB 1400 if it came to my desk, but I would use my influence with the California legislature to pass it in the first place. We must fix democracy if we want universal health care for the people,” said Luis Rodriguez, Green candidate for Governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Greens have had single-payer healthcare in their platform [2] since their formation in the early 90’s. Greens assert – along with California Nurses Association [3] and many grassroots organizations – that healthcare is a human right, not a privilege, and that it is cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Follow the money! Many studies, including an analysis [4] from the University of California, San Francisco, have shown that single-payer healthcare would not only save lives — an excellent goal — but it would also save money,&quot; said Laura Wells, Green candidate for State Controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his 2018 campaign, Gavin Newsom signaled his strong support for single-payer [5]. Since then he has received massive donations from its opponents, among them the healthcare insurance industry [6]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why is the Democratic Party refusing to hear and serve Californians? Because Democratic elected officials pass legislation to benefit their donors, not their constituents,” said Barry Hermanson, a long-time Green and healthcare advocate in San Francisco. “California Democratic Party elected leaders, and in particular Governor Gavin Newsom, are putting profits before people’s lives,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democrats have no excuse for failing to pass CalCare [7]. Since 2018 the Democrats have had a veto-proof supermajority in the California legislature [8]. For 50 out of 52 years they have controlled the California House and Senate [9]. As the largest progressive state in the country, California could be the leader in passing transformative and much needed healthcare reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Given a pandemic, a budget surplus in the state, a 10-year super-majority in both houses of the legislature, and an upcoming primary election in June, many of us thought that maybe this time the Democratic Party would come through, but wrong again!!&quot; said Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This fiasco helped me understand why people hang onto hope that the Democratic Party will act. Even I had hope for it this time, and I’m a Green who has witnessed 30 years of the failures of Democratic politicians. Elect Greens and Peace and Freedom candidates who never take corporate money,” Wells added.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>California Greens Endorse a Left Unity Slate with the Peace and Freedom Party for 2022 Elections</title>
 <link>https://cagreens.org/california-greens-endorse-left-unity-slate-peace-and-freedom-party-2022-elections</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/WHT%20G.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;96&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press Release - October 26, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California delegates have voted to endorse a “Left Unity Slate” composed of Green Party and Peace and Freedom Party candidates for the June 2022 Primary Elections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Blenner (Green), CA Secretary of State&lt;br /&gt;
Laura Wells (Green), CA Controller&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Kapelovitz (Green), CA Attorney General&lt;br /&gt;
Meghann Adams (Peace and Freedom), CA Treasurer&lt;br /&gt;
Nathalie Hrizi (Peace and Freedom), CA Insurance Commissioner&lt;br /&gt;
John Parker (Peace and Freedom), US Senate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO, CA - A historic decision, this united strategy was based on the many shared values between the Green and the Peace and Freedom political parties. Among these values are guaranteed access to healthcare, also known as expanded and improved Medicare For All, truly affordable housing, union-wage jobs, public ownership of energy, ending wars for profit, and a comprehensive climate plan, including a just transition to 100 percent renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2020 presidential elections when the Green Party’s Howie Hawkins and Socialist running mate Angela Walker formed the first “Left Unity&#039;&#039; campaign, the movement for a united left has gained support among independent voters. “We need to unite the many against the few that finance the two big capitalist parties,” Hawkins said &lt;https:&gt; during his campaign. “We need our own political voice. We need our own independent power.”&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance Commissioner candidate Nathalie Hrizi said, “Our campaign calls for a single-payer healthcare system that removes the insurance companies altogether. A state single-payer system would guarantee health care for all people, with the state government paying all medical bills. It would be like Medicare for all. Contrary to right-wing propaganda, Medicare is far more efficient than private insurers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The question always comes up about how do we pay for what we need,” said Laura Wells, candidate for CA Controller. &quot;There are solutions. We can implement Public Banking so that our state and localities stop paying high interest to Wall Street banks. We can save money with a rational healthcare system, which Democratic leadership again stalled despite having a super-majority and a budget surplus. And we can certainly tax the rich! Nobody needs to be a billionaire, and Forbes tells us California has 189 of them, up 24 from the year before. That makes no sense, the rest of us are already paying fees and fines and tuition and taxes. Tax the rich.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we had electoral reform, such as multi-winner ranked-choice voting, a candidate-based form of proportional representation, California’s voters would have a bigger voice in policies that are critical to their lives,” said Gary Blenner, candidate for CA Secretary of State. “For example, we would be leading the way in implementing a single-payer healthcare system rather than allowing the Democrats to wipe it off the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through this early endorsement step, the Green Party plans to help Greens from across the state get engaged in the campaigns of these endorsed candidates early and help build support for these corporate-free campaigns that do not accept contributions from corporations and their industry lobbyists,” said Greg Jan, Statewide Candidate Subcommittee member, and Green Voter Guide editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional candidates, including Governor, will be considered for endorsement in early December.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Green Party of California Opposes Recall, Endorses Dan Kapelovitz</title>
 <link>https://cagreens.org/green-party-california-opposes-recall-endorses-dan-kapelovitz</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/LeafG.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;95&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press Release - September 8, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacramento - The Green Party of California voted overwhelmingly both to vote no on the recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom and to endorse Green Party member Dan Kapelovitz as his replacement should the recall vote pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Kapelovitz is one of many former Bernie Sanders supporters who have joined the Green Party since 2016. He has a long record of grassroots activism, showing that for decades he has been aligned with the 10 Key Values of the Green Party. An attorney who also teaches law at the People’s College of Law in Los Angeles, his clients are mainly poor people caught up in the criminal justice system, as well as defenders of animal rights. More information about his campaign can be found online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://kapelovitz.com&quot;&gt;https://kapelovitz.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I oppose this recall. Governor Newsom and the Democratic Party have recklessly endangered the residents of this state by strong-arming all arguably qualified Democrats into not taking part in the race to potentially replace him, thus leaving the field to far-right Republicans. Should this desperate gamble to persuade Californians to vote no on the recall fail, I am the progressive candidate most able to win, to govern effectively, and to pursue a strong reform agenda,&quot; said Dan Kapelovitz. &quot;A vote for my Green candidacy can be a transformational vote for more choice and more voice for Californians, via ranked-choice voting and proportional representation elections. These critically needed reforms would lead to a viable multi-party system for California, giving more people in our state a seat at the table of our democracy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greens oppose the recall because the lack of ranked-choice voting or a required runoff in this recall election creates the potential for a replacement to be elected by only a tiny minority of the voting public, and the candidates receiving the most attention are no better than Newsom and in many cases, far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The vote to oppose the recall is by no means a statement of support for Newsom,&quot; said Laura Wells, official spokesperson for the Green Party of California, and a former candidate for Governor herself in 2010. &quot;Newsom has had Democratic Party super-majorities in both houses of the legislature and still his actions and inactions have continually gone against Californians’ progressive values. During this pandemic, he has thwarted Californians’ ability to receive unemployment benefits and receive rent subsidies. He has failed to address the climate crisis, stop fracking, hold PG&amp;amp;E accountable for its continued disaster inducing incompetence, or require it to compensate victims in a timely and appropriate manner, and he has failed to raise billions to fight the climate crisis by imposing a severance tax on oil and gas extraction, as is standard in other states.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite having a budget surplus and despite the pandemic, Newsom and his supermajorities stunningly betrayed Californian voters by delaying consideration of a single-payer healthcare bill until sometime after 2021,&quot; said Wells. &quot;He also vetoed a measure that would have enhanced democracy and broadened representation by allowing cities across California to use ranked-choice voting in local elections.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapelovitz&#039; choice to feature ranked-choice voting and proportional representation continues the Green Party&#039;s longstanding mission to restore accountability and authentic choice to California&#039;s electoral process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need these democracy enhancing reforms to end one-party rule, and give progressives a voice in Sacramento not chained to a party co-opted and corrupted by corporate donations and the 1%,&quot; said Greg Jan, coordinator of the Statewide Candidates Subcommittee. &quot;A vote for Kapelovitz on September 14, and for Green candidates in next June&#039;s primary election, sends a strong message that Californians embrace progressive policies and electoral reform.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recall election ballots must be postmarked no later than election day, Tuesday, September 14, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>California Greens Accelerate Call for EcoSocialist Green New Deal</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/IMG_4205%202.JPG&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOR RELEASE: July 27, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California Greens Accelerate Call for EcoSocialist Green New Deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California has taken three crucial steps in its push for comprehensive actions on the climate crisis and vast social inequality in the face of Democratic and Republican politicians’ failure to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July, Green Party delegates from across the state voted to take an unequivocal stand on the party’s identity as EcoSocialist by adding a critical preamble to their platform stating that the alternative social, economic, and political system Greens have advocated for decades is EcoSocialism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cagreens.org/platform&quot;&gt;https://www.cagreens.org/platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently the Green Party took the step of filing an updated statement of purpose with the California Secretary of State to also incorporate the term EcoSocialism. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cagreens.org//green-party-statement-purpose-2021&quot;&gt;https://www.cagreens.org//green-party-statement-purpose-2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a third step, on July 18 the state party joined 110 other organizations to sign onto a letter drafted by the Green Party of the United States EcoAction Committee urging Biden and Congress to immediately fund an EcoSocialist Green New Deal with an annual $4.1 trillion investment for 10 years to help prevent climate collapse while helping our country recover from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gp.org/as_extreme_weather_rages_globally_climate_groups_demand_biden_and_congressional_democrats_fund_a_robust_ecosocialist_green_new_deal&quot;&gt;https://www.gp.org/as_extreme_weather_rages_globally_climate_groups_dema...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing the term &quot;EcoSocialism&quot; has been an ongoing process for Greens, both nationally and locally, as the concept describes the key anti-oppression and anti-capitalist values on which the Green Party has been built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins ran on an EcoSocialist Green New Deal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://howiehawkins.us/ecosocialist-green-new-deal/&quot;&gt;https://howiehawkins.us/ecosocialist-green-new-deal/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why embrace the word EcoSocialism? First, ‘Eco’ denotes the need for us to live in harmony with the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the word ‘Socialism&#039; has been weaponized far too long by free marketeers against social programs and institutions that benefit people in the US and other countries,&quot; said Nassim Nouri, member of the Green Party of California’s state Coordinating Committee. &quot;It’s about time we in the US face the truth that we need EcoSocialism for our survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Green New Deal was proposed in both Britain and the United States over a decade ago by Greens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2019 a drastically weakened Green New Deal was introduced in Washington DC with great fanfare, and then pushed to the back burner by the Democratic Party leadership, including California politicians Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dianne Feinstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both refuse to support a Green New Deal despite the severity of the climate crisis, a global pandemic, the unconscionable rise in both inequality and injustice, and despite wide-spread approval of a Green New Deal among their constituents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How will we pay for it? Biden’s administration is finding the money to upgrade nuclear weaponry, increase the Pentagon budget, ramp up interventions in other countries, and retain more than half of Trump’s corporate tax cuts,&quot; said Laura Wells, spokesperson for the Green Party of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop those plans. Action on climate and inequality is needed now. We will pay for the EcoSocialist Green New Deal the same way those destructive plans were being paid for,” Wells added.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Green Party of California stands against the brutal apartheid regime of Israel</title>
 <link>https://cagreens.org/green-party-california-stands-against-brutal-apartheid-regime-israel</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/bombingbyIsrael%202.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;72&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Green Party of California stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people and with their fight against the brutal apartheid regime of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 8th, 2021 - The 11-day carpet bombing of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military from May 10 to May 21, 2021, killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and injured over 1,700 people &lt;https:&gt;. More than 1,000 buildings, schools, hospitals, businesses and roads have been destroyed by devastating airstrikes leaving at least 6,000 residents homeless, displacing tens of thousands, and depriving almost half of the population of Gaza of access to water and electricity in the midst of a raging pandemic and without the protection of a vaccine.&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas brokered by Egyptian mediators on May 21, Israeli forces and settlers have since attacked the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem multiple times and continued to evict Israeli Arabs from their homes after building a blockade in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Operation &quot;Law and Order&quot; &lt;https:&gt; is currently targeting over 500 Palestinian citizens of Israel in retaliation for their participation in demonstrations against the occupation and the settlers&#039; violence. &quot;The occupation is the root cause of the violence,&quot; Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki explained. &lt;https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These war crimes follow the hallmarks of genocide that Israel is perpetuating against Palestinians living under its rule in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The ongoing destruction of Palestinian homes, villages and whole communities is not new: it started 73 years ago and continues to this day. The mass exodus of at least 750,000 Arabs from Palestine, the &quot;Nakba&quot; (the catastrophe), was followed by the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. Then came the Israeli wars on Gaza of 2008, 2012, and 2014 - during which over 2,000 Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli forces &lt;https:&gt;, among them 1,220 children.&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Nakba is made possible by U.S.&#039;s financial, technological and military assistance, using U.S. taxpayer money, which makes our country a consistent and willing accomplice of Israel in crimes against humanity. The U.S. government gives $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel every year &lt;https:&gt; as part of a 10-year agreement made under the Obama administration in 2016. The U.S. has repeatedly vetoed the United Nations Security Council resolutions &lt;https:&gt; to condemn Israel&#039;s military response and to call for a ceasefire. Even today, President Biden refuses to hold the Israeli government led by the current Prime Minister Netanyahu accountable for the continuous violation of Palestinian rights and security, and falsely claims Israel is exercising its &quot;right to defend itself&quot; instead. In the midst of Israeli aggressions against Palestinians, the Biden administration approved the sale of precision-guided weapons to Israel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;https:&gt; while Israel was bombing Gaza and killing civilians, in direct violation of human rights and international law. And on June 3, 2021, less than two weeks after the ceasefire, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz arrived in Washington, D.C., to ask for $1 billion more to replenish Israel’s “Iron Dome” and to purchase additional precision-guided missiles. Meanwhile, President Biden is merely allocating $110 million to rebuild Palestinian homes that he contributed to annihilate...&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though a few Democrats have recently called out Biden for his unconditional support of Israel, their opposition remains slow and weak. On May 20, 2021, almost two weeks after the start of the recent conflict, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib and Senator Bernie Sanders introduced sister resolutions to block the Biden administration’s $735 million arms sale to Israel &lt;https:&gt; while Congress was informed about the arms sale on May 5. They then quickly dropped their joint effort after hearing that the sale had been approved. &lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats and Republicans alike usually do not question our nation’s backing of Israel’s institutionalized discrimination and disproportionate use of violence against Palestinians. &quot;My Congressperson is Barbara Lee,&quot; said Laura Wells, Green Party of California spokesperson and 2018 Green Party candidate for Congress in California’s District 13 opposing Barbara Lee. &quot;She has played it extremely safe. She has indicated that she is supportive in theory, but at best she has signed onto a few noncontroversial positions such as ending military detention of Palestinian children. Meanwhile, she has taken campaign contributions from Lockheed Martin, the largest arms-producing company in the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ajamu Baraka, the national organizer of the Black Alliance for Peace and 2016 Green Party candidate for vice president wrote “In the alternative world of Western liberalism, some lives are more equal and more valuable than others,” noting &quot;the colonial/capitalist West is prepared to sacrifice everything and everyone in order to maintain its global dominance, even if it means destroying the planet and everyone on it.&quot; &lt;https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Green Party of California calls for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- An immediate end to economic and political colonialism worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
- An immediate end to U.S. weapons sales and all military aid to Israel.&lt;br /&gt;
- An end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and the restoration of the right of Palestinian people to self-determination &lt;https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt; as stipulated in multiple U.N. resolutions and included in our platform &lt;https:&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
- Full support for the right of return of over seven million displaced Palestinian refugees, and for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement led by Palestinians &lt;https:&gt;&lt;/https:&gt; and inspired by the South-African anti-apartheid movement.&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 20, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact:&lt;br /&gt;
Laura Wells, 510-504-4254, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:lwells@cagreens.org&quot;&gt;lwells@cagreens.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;lwells&gt; (GPCA spokesperson)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greens reject excuses by the U.S. and Israel for violence against Palestinians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO - In direct defiance of the will of the United Nations, the Israeli government has escalated bombing attacks on the Palestinian people. As an excuse for Israel’s attacks, the United States has said that Israel has the &quot;right to defend itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Green Party rejects the &#039;self-defense’ excuse. Colonizers can’t claim self-defense,” said Noura Khouri, Green Party of the United States delegate from California, and national committee member of the Al-Awda Right to Return Coalition of the Palestine Action Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under international law, Palestinians have a right to resist and to self-defense. Yet they have no formal military, while they are being ruthlessly attacked by Israel, which has nuclear weapons, has one of the most powerful military forces in the world, and is backed politically, diplomatically, and financially by the United States. Without U.S. support, it would not be possible for Israel to wage this murderous campaign of terror on Palestinians,&quot; said Khouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel&#039;s decades-long land annexations and settlements are a violation of human rights and international law according to numerous UN resolutions. In April 2021, Human Rights Watch joined hundreds of other international human rights organizations — among them the Jerusalem-based non-profit B’Tselem &lt;https:&gt; — to condemn Israel for &quot;crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution,&quot; and to ask for an end to the violence.&lt;/https:&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of the United States backs the right of return as stipulated in UN resolution 194, and supports the implementation of boycott and divestment initiatives similar to those applied to South Africa in their apartheid era. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Palestinians have some of the best minds and highest levels of education in the world, they have fertile and productive lands, and they have many resources. It is the Israeli occupation, backed by the US, that creates the poverty and hunger they suffer,&quot; said Tarik Kanaana, a member of the Coordinating Committee of the Green Party of California. &quot;Security comes from respecting human rights and allowing people to have control over their own lives. What we need from the US most right now is to stop backing Israel politically, militarily and financially.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is time to ask something greater of ourselves and of Israel. Only when the strongest lay down their arms can the world begin to find its way to peace,&quot; said Susan Lamont, former coordinator of the Peace &amp;amp; Justice Center of Sonoma County, and Green Party of Sonoma County council member. &quot;While the Greens honor the tender spot within the Jewish people formed by the burden and pain of their history, we also understand that their well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of all others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  April 26, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Party of California condemns Democratic Party ‘betrayal’ for shelving of Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, AB 1400&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*On April 7, 2021, Green Party of California endorsed AB1 400&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO – In a stunning betrayal of Californians, lawmakers in Sacramento delayed until 2022 the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act, Assembly Bill 1400. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California aligns with a growing majority of Californians and many coalition partners in condemning this decision by the lawmakers.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Universal single-payer healthcare lies at the heart of the Green Party of California healthcare platform,&quot; said Barry Hermanson, long-time single-payer advocate and member of the GPCA Coordinating Committee. See Big Pharma and Universal health care: California tries again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The pandemic has shown us the weakness of the current privatized health care system,&quot; said Hermanson. &quot;Four years ago Sacramento floated and sunk a healthcare bill, and they gave the same excuse: needing to figure out the financing. We already know this bill will not only save lives but also save money in the long run. What did Sacramento do in four years? Nothing but lip service, even while facing a global pandemic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly three million Californians have no health insurance and millions more have insurance they can’t afford to use because their copays, premiums, and deductibles are too high and continue to rise. Polling shows that roughly 55 percent of registered California voters either somewhat or strongly agree that a single-payer program &quot;would improve the nation’s ability to respond to disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elected leaders in California have no excuse not to take AB 1400 and run with it,&quot; said Laura Wells, Green Party of California spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added, &quot;California has what is called a Democratic super trifecta, with the Governor’s seat and super-majorities in both houses of the legislature. Governor Newsom ran on supporting single payer during his campaign in 2018. Now, especially with the COVID crisis, is the time to pass guaranteed healthcare for all Californians.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2021, GPCA endorsed a petition to ask Governor Newsom to begin fulfilling his promise of implementing single-payer in California by requesting the necessary federal Medicare waivers from the Biden administration in its first 100 days. The Governor has not yet made this request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CalCare program would provide comprehensive universal single-payer health care coverage and a health care cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state regardless of employment, income, immigration status, race, gender, or any other considerations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the AB 1400 bill text, &quot;Billions of dollars that could be spent on providing equal access to health care are wasted on administrative costs necessary in a multipayer health care system. Resources and costs spent on administration would be dramatically reduced in a single-payer system, allowing health care professionals and hospitals to focus on patient care instead.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. spends more per person on health care than any other nation in the world, yet the U.S. ranks last compared with six comparable industrialized countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) in quality, efficiency, and equity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While an estimated 68,000 Americans die each year from the lack of access to care, insurance companies are reporting record profits. This year the losses are off the charts with nearly a third of all COVID deaths linked to lack of health insurance&quot; said Dr. Jill Stein, the 2016 Green Party presidential nominee, and a physician advocate for healthcare justice since the 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;
She adds &quot;Healthcare is not a partisan issue nor a matter of progressive vs. conservative politics. Access to free, high-quality healthcare is a human rights issue. A supermajority of Americans are demanding it and it&#039;s only the corruption of big money in politics that stands in our way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Immediate Release: June 5, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California Statement on the Murder of George Floyd and Police Brutality Aimed at People of Color&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Party of California&lt;br /&gt;
Contact: Laura Wells,&lt;br /&gt;
916.448.3437, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:gpca@cagreens.org&quot;&gt;gpca@cagreens.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California stands in solidarity with the Black and Brown community and condemns the brutal murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers on May 25th. We join the Movement for Black Lives in calling for the arrest and prosecution of all police officers involved in George Floyd&#039;s murder, the end to police brutality and to the global racialized capitalist system.&lt;br /&gt;
This violent criminal act at the hands of police who are supposed to protect people from harm stems from a widespread culture of racism, white supremacy, and disregard for black lives that dates back to slavery.  The resulting outrage and global protests by diverse communities rightfully demand that we fundamentally change our society, and our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Floyd is another victim in a series of racialized killings by police forces that have been going on for centuries in the United States. In California, since the beating of Rodney King by LAPD in 1991, numerous unarmed black and brown people have been executed by law enforcement officers including Oscar Grant, murdered by Oakland BART police officers in 2008, 13-year-old Andy Lopez shot by a Sonoma County sheriff&#039;s deputy in Santa Rosa in 2013, Antonio Guzman Lopez killed by San Jose State University police officers in 2014, Luis Gongora Pat shot and killed by SFPD in 2016, and Stephon Clark killed by two Sacramento police officers in 2018. And just this week, amidst protests over the killing of George Floyd, Sean Monterrosa was murdered by a police officer when kneeling outside a store in Vallejo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 report revealed that African American men had been killed by police in California at eight times the rate of other residents since 2005, even though they only made up about 3% of the state&#039;s population at the time. In 2018 in San Francisco, SFPD stopped black people at rates over five times their representation in the city’s overall population. California also has some of the strictest laws protecting officers from being held accountable for shootings in criminal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California condemns the curfew orders issued across California that are clearly an attempt to suppress people&#039;s rights to assembly and free speech, and also allow law enforcement to more easily arrest protesters, particularly people of color. Communities of color and working families already victimized by more violent policing, are also the most impacted financially by the shelter-in-place orders, and the most likely to lose their jobs, their health insurance and become ill due to COVID-19. That’s why we MUST listen to the demands of the Black and Brown community today.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California joins the National Black Caucus of the Green Party of the United States and the Young EcoSocialists in demanding accountability and community control of the police. The Green Party supports the ability of cities to establish civilian police review boards to increase understanding between community members and police officers and sheriff&#039;s deputies that go beyond standard government bureaucracy. These boards would provide a public forum to air concerns on policy matters with sufficient autonomy and authority to ensure public oversight and accountability of their local police department or sheriff&#039;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party platform calls for criminal justice reform to reverse the national policy of racially selective mass incarceration and to end police militarization. Curfews, police brutality, the use of tear gas, kettling, and restraining techniques such as choke holds are tactics employed by military states to intimidate and squash dissent. Social uprisings and unrest arise from injustice, not violence.&lt;br /&gt;
The racial, social, economic, and environmental crises we continue to face are the direct result of the capitalist system that puts profit over people, peace, and the planet. These interconnected crises, exacerbated by the current unprecedented COVID health crisis, disproportionately affect front-line low-wage workers and communities of color. Access to free universal healthcare, guaranteed jobs at a living wage, free high-quality education, affordable housing, clean water, and public ownership of energy (aka a REAL Green New Deal) are basic human rights that a true democratic government should provide.&lt;br /&gt;
Authors from Malcolm X to Richard Wolff have noted how capitalism supports racism. The historical moment has arrived for us to banish racism, capitalism, and other forms of oppression from our society.  We must not fail to answer that call.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Green Party of California Opposes the CalAm Desalination Project in Monterey County</title>
 <link>https://cagreens.org/green-party-california-opposes-calam-desalination-project</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-feature-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://cagreens.org/sites/cagreens.huang.radicaldesigns.org/files/MarinaDune.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;96&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California opposes the California American Water (CalAm) Slant Well Desalination Project in Monterey County&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Immediate Release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact: Laura Wells, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:lwells@cagreens.org&quot;&gt;lwells@cagreens.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 16, 2019, San Francisco, CA - The Green Party of California released the following statement in opposition to the California American Water (CalAm) Slant Well Desalination Project and sent a letter to the California Coastal Commission (CCC) stating concerns about the project’s environmental and social justice impact and urging the commission to deny the project permit in favor of proven, environmentally just, and responsible alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CalAm Desalination Project proposes to build slant wells within the City of Marina in Monterey County. CalAm would pump fresh and brackish groundwater for desalinization in order to provide drinking water solely for the more affluent neighboring communities such as Carmel. The California Coastal Commission has been in the process of assessing the project for months and is scheduled to complete a staff report prior to the November 14th commission hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The CalAm project is wrong on so many levels,&quot; says Marina Mayor and California Green Party member Bruce Delgado. &quot;Besides threatening the fresh groundwater on which Marina’s low-income community depends for its drinking water, this experimental, $1.2 Billion project would permanently destroy dune habitats slated for protection.”&lt;br /&gt;
Noting that the working-class ethnically diverse City of Marina is already burdened with industrial facilities such as the regional landfill and sewage plant, Mayor Delgado says “This is environmental injustice at its worst. It benefits CalAm’s shareholders but would cost ratepayers 3 times as much as the environmentally friendlier recycled water option that all local water agencies support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since the slant well technology is still experimental, there’s a high risk of seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin,&quot; says Marina Water Conservation Commission member and Green Party activist Audra Walton. &quot;If our groundwater is contaminated, Marina residents will be forced to find other sources of water, most likely with CalAm, and we will end up paying a much higher price than what we are paying now with the Marina Coast Water District.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Decisions about water must be based on an integrated ecosystems approach and with the collaboration of all stakeholders,&quot; says Green Party of California spokesperson Laura Wells. &quot;This ensures responsible water use and limits environmental injustice, ecological impact, and depletion of groundwater supplies. That is why the Green Party of California joins the Citizens for Just Water group to oppose this environmentally and socially irresponsible project.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative solution would expand the existing Pure Water Monterey recycled water project and cost $200M to build. This approach focuses on the replenishment of the groundwater supply and protection of the environment, and is considered a more sustainable and cost-effective solution compared to the CalAm project.

&lt;p&gt;Green Party of California&#039;s water platform plank (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cagreens.org/platform/water&quot;&gt;http://www.cagreens.org/platform/water&lt;/a&gt;) emphasizes a holistic ‘watershed approach’ to managing our desert state&#039;s precious water resources, so in that perspective, the Pure Water Monterey Project aligns well with the Green Party’s platform on water management. The platform stresses that the principle of bioregionalism - living within the means of a region&#039;s natural resources - as well as water conservation must be essential parts of any responsible and sustainable water policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Party of California also believes that access to clean, potable, and affordable water is a basic human right, a principle which is shared by the State Water Resources Board and its human-right-to-water policies.  “It is, unfortunately, a right that is denied to many low-income and marginalized communities, even more so in a drought-stricken state like California,” states Laura Wells. “We believe GPCA has a responsibility to support the local environmental and social justice organizations who are challenging the for-profit industry taking control of the water supply their communities depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re:  Environmental Justice issues related to the CalAm Slant Well Desalination Project &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date:  October 15, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Chair Dayna Bochco and Coastal Commissioners:&lt;br /&gt;
The Green Party of California urges the California Coastal Commission (CCC) to deny the CalAm Desalination Project Coastal Development Permit. We encourage the CCC to instead support alternatives such as the proven and environmentally just recycling approaches used by the Pure Water Monterey Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current CalAm project will have significant environmental and social justice impact on the Communities of Marina and former Fort Ord. CalAm, a for-profit private corporation, would be illegally extracting groundwater from under the neighboring disadvantaged community of Marina harming the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin, and jeopardizing the integrity of the water source that provides 100% of Marina’s water needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina is a unique community, with a working-class ethnic population, many of whom do not read or speak English. It is a “disadvantaged community” under federal and state definitions, with a census track that is one of the most burdened in the State.&lt;br /&gt;
The project would impose an unfair industrial burden on Marina which is already saddled with a disproportionate number of industrial regional facilities, waste management, landfill and sewage plant, anaerobic digester, regional beach sand mining, etc. Adding yet another facility that imposes the primary burden of construction and operation on this community is true environmental injustice, particularly because the City of Marina will not even receive any of the desalinated water the project would produce.&lt;br /&gt;
All of the benefits of this project will go to the wealthier communities on the Peninsula along with CalAm shareholders, while the social, economic and environmental burdens would be imposed by Marina residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental impact of this project is also very concerning, as it would cause permanent damage to environmentally sensitive habitat areas on Marina’s shoreline, destroying important dune ecosystems on which many species depend, and upon which Marina’s tourism industry relies. It would lead to discharging high volumes of brine into the ocean, emitting high levels of CO2 into the atmosphere leading to unnecessary health risks, and also to inducing further seawater intrusion into the groundwater basin.&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, the project completely undermines the decades-long efforts by the City to end the destructive sand mining operations on the CEMEX site in favor of conservation and recreation. The CEMEX industrial facility, would be replaced by yet another environmentally impactful industrial project.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the worst consequences of this project would be its adverse impact on current groundwater supply and the resulting access and cost issues for residents.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, water supplied by the Marina Coast Water District is low cost and affordable. If the groundwater basin is adversely impacted by the CalAm project, through seawater intrusion, the residents of Marina will be forced to find other sources of water, most likely with CalAm, whose customers currently pay the highest water rates in the nation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicwaternow.org/most_expensive_water&quot;&gt;http://www.publicwaternow.org/most_expensive_water&lt;/a&gt;). The expected enormous rate increases for this essential resource, would likely force many residents out of the area who are already financially struggling given the State’s shortage of affordable housing. A report by Azul on the impact of water costs in disadvantaged communities clearly demonstrates these concerns. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://azul.org/en/blog/ucla-report-poseidon-desalination-would-hurt-low-income-ratepayers/&quot;&gt;https://azul.org/en/blog/ucla-report-poseidon-desalination-would-hurt-lo...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative projects using recycled water approaches that cost far less are already in process of being completed in Monterey County that would make desalination projects such as CalAm’s superfluous. Unlike the slant well drilling which is still experimental, the use of recycled water has already been proven successful in many coastal regions such as Orange county, where it is now the norm. Recycled water also cost far less than &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the many concerns raised by the CalAm Desalination Project Coastal Development make it an unacceptable and unjust environmental and social burden on Marina and former Fort Ord Communities.  This is a high-risk project in an ill-advised location, and could forever adversely impact the lives and livelihood of an already disadvantaged community, as well as this fragile coastal environment.&lt;br /&gt;
The Green Party of California urges the CCC to deny a permit for this project for the many reasons listed above but particularly because it is not consistent with the Commission’s goal to prevent environmental injustice imposed on our coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
Maxine Daniel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinating Committee, Alternate Co-Coordinator&lt;br /&gt;
