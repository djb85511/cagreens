# Original cagreens.org repository

This git repository is a backup of cagreens.org. It includes 2459 web pages. 
History is very imprtant to the Green Pary.  This archive include numerous position statements, 
meeting minutes, and other important information, much of which is still relevant. 

In the root of this repository there are two scripts, get and extract.  To use them, first clone this repository.  
Get will then download any new pages, but not edited pages.  Extract will extract the contents, throwing away the 
template and any meta informaiton in the header. Be careful about using extract.
